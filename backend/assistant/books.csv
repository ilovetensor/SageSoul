In fact, light articles are predominant in properties of vayu and agni  while others (heavy ones) are the same in those of prthivT and soma (ap). So. by dint  of their properties, the light articles being slimulant of digestion, even taken upto the  saturation point, produce little derangement. (On the contrary) the heavy articles  because of dissimilarity, are not stimulant of digestion by nature and thus cause con- siderable derangment if taken upto the saturation point except in case (of persons  having) physical exercise and (adequate) strength of agni (digestion).

527,13-Dec,

In that case, induction of vomiting after feeding, smoking, fasting (or light  diet), blood-letting, rough diet, physical exercises and purgation are prescribed. ",
529,14-15,

547," Suppression of breathing due to exercise causes gaseous tumour, heart diseases  and fainting. Rest and the measures for alleviating vata are prescribed to overcome  this condition. ",
548,24,

550,25,

557,27,
558," One should check the impending urge of speech which is harsh, betraying, lie  and untimely used. ",
559,28,
560," Whatever bodily action causes pain to orhers like adultery, theft and violence  should be checked in its impending urges. ",
561,29,
562," The virtuous-named person, because of having thought, speech and action free  from vices, is really happy and enjoys and earns virtue, wealth and desire. ",
563,30,
564," The bodily movement which is meant for producing firmness and strength is known  By physical exercise one gets lightness, capacity to work, firmness, tolerance of  difficulties, diminution of impurity and stimulation of agni (digestion and metabo- lism). ",
565,32,
566," Excessive physical exercise gives rise to fatigue, exhaustion, emaciation, thirst,  internal haemorrhage, darkness before eyes, cough, fever and vomiting. ",
567,33,
568," (Appearance of perspiration, increased respiration, lightness of the organs,  feeling of obstruction in cardiac region etc. are the signs of proper physical  exercise). (1) The wise should not indulge excessively in physical exercise, laughter,  speech, travelling on foot, sexual intercourse and night-vigil even if he is accustomed  to them. ",
569,34,
570, One who indulges excessively in these or similar other activities perishes sud- denly like a lion dragging an elephant. ,

575," grief, fear and exertion, the children, the old and those having aggravated vata, those  who speak too much and loudly; are hungry and thirsty should abstain from physical excercise.) (1-2) A wise person should alienate himself from the habitual malpractices gradually.  Adoption of good practices should also be in similar way. The gradual order should  In the first phase, alienation and adoption should be limited to the quarter por- tion. The second phase should be on the next day and succeeding phases at the inter- val of two and three days respectively. ",
576,36-37,
577, Demerits given up gradually and merits adopted in the same way become ever-  prevented and unshakable respectively. ,
578,38,
579," From the very time of conception, some persons are having equilibrium of pitta,  vata and kapha while others are seen vatala, pittala or slesmala (having predominance  of vata or pitta or kapha). Amongest them, those in the first category are disease-free while others  (vatala etc.) are always ill. Ever attachment of a particular dosa is known as body  constitution. ",
580,39-40,
581," For them, those measures of health are prescribed which are opposite to proper- ties (of that particular dosa). For the one having equilibrium of dhatus use of all the  rasas equally would be wholesome and is thus recommended. ",
582,41,
583," Two below (anus and urethra), seven in head, other channels and openings of  sweat (glands) are excretory passages which are obstructed by excreta vitiated and  increased in quantity. ",
584,42,
585, Increase in malas should be known by heaviness and decrease in those by light- ness of the excretory passages and also by excessive constipation and elimination of  excreta respectively. ,

590," After ascertaining the disorders with the help of signs and symptoms of dosas,  one should treat them, if they are curable, by prescribing therapies contradictory to  the etiological factors paying due consideration to dosa and time. ",
591,44,
592,  These direases and other ones arise in persons who do not follow the routine  prescribed for health, hence the one who wants to be disease-free should follow the  course for the healthy. 
593,45,
594," One should get the accumulation of dosas evacuated in the first month of spring,  rainy season and winter. The wise should administer emetics, purgatives, enema and  snuff to those who have got their body oleated and fomented. Thereafter, one who  knows times should administer tried rasayanas and aphrodisiac formulations in order  and according to suitability. Thus, dhatus having been stabilised in normal condition,  diseases do not arise, dhatus are promoted and aging process is slowed down. This  method for prevention of innate disorders is described here, that for others would be  described separately. ",
595,46-50,
596," In the exogenous diseases which are caused in men by organism, poison, wind,  fire, etc. there is error of intellect. Psychological disorders like envy, grief, fear,  anger, vanity, aversion etc. are also said to be caused by intellectual error. ",
597,51-52,
598," Forsaking the intellectual errors, Calmness of sense organs, memory, sound knowl- edge of place, time and self and following the code of good conduct-this is the way  shown for prevention of exogenous diseases. The wise should do quite early what he  thinks wholesome for himself. ",
599,53-54,
600, Good knowledge of the instructions of the authorities and their implementation  is the cause (means) for prevention and alleviation of diseases. ,

605," Those with vicious action, speech and thought, informers, quarrelsome, who  ridicule the vulnereble points, the greedy, envious of other's prosperity, crooked,  who indulge in blackmailing others, the unstable, those who serve the enemy, cruel,  who have given up the virtuous path-such mean persons should be avoided. ",
606,56-57,
607," Those endowed with wisdom, learning, age, good conduct, memory and balanced  mind, aged, having company of the aged, knowers of nature, free from pains, good  looking to all, peaceful; who have taken sojne (virtuous) vow, preachers of good con- duct, whose narrative and sight are virtuous-should be kept company of with humility  and sense of service. ",
608,58-59,
609," The wise, who desires happiness here and hereafter, should make best effort to  practise the wholesome in respect of diet, conduct and actions. ",
610,60,
611," One should not take curd in night, without ghee and sugar, without soup of green  gram, honey or amalaka and that which is hot. One fond of curd and using it reck- lessly suffers from fever, innate haemorrhage, erysipelas, anemia, giddiness and severe  jaundice. [61-621 Now the summing up verses- Urges, diseases caused by holding up these urges and their treatment, the urges  to be held up, wholesome and unholesome, the gradual order in adoption and giving  up the benefecial and harmful habits, diet according to constitution, disorders of the  excretory passage and their treatment, prevention and cure of diseases, persons who  should be avoided and kept company of by the wise desiring self-happiness and the  method of taking curd-about all these, the sage, born of Atri, said in the chapter of  non-suppression of urges. ",
612,63-66,
613, Thus ends the seventh chapter on non-suppresion of urges in Slokasthana  in the treatise composed by Agnivesa and redcated by Caraka. (7) ,

615,0,
616, Now (I) shall expound the chapter on introductory description of sense-  organs. [ 1  ] As propounded by Lord Atreya. ,
617,2,
618," Here are five sense organs, five matters of sense organs, five locations of sense  organs, five sense objects and five sense perceptions, thus said in the context of sense  organs. ",
619,3,
620," Mind transcends the sense organs, it is known as sattva while some call it as  cetas. Its action is dependent on its objects and accomplishment of self and at the  same time, it is responsible for the action of sense organs. ",
621,4,
622," Apparently, mind, in person, seems to be more than one because of variations in  its own objects, sense objects and its analytical activity and also due to conjuction  with the qualities of rajas, tamas and sattwa; but, in fact, there is no numerousness.  One (mind) does not attend to more than one at a time that is why there is no activity  of all the sense organs simultaneously. ",
623,5,
624, The quality which is predominantly and time and again present in mind of a  person is the basis on which sages have described the mind according to pre- dominance. (6] The sense organs are capable of perceiving their objects only when they are sup- ported by mind. ,
625,7,
626," Visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory and tactile are the five sense organs. ",
627,8,
628," Five matters of sense organs are-Akasa, Vayu, Tejas, Ap and Prthivl. ",
629,9,
630, ,
631,page_no: ,
632,0,
633," Eyes, ears, nostrils, tongue and skin-these five are locations of sense organs. ",
634,10,
635,"  Five sense objects are-sound, touch, vision, taste and smell. ",
636,11,
637," Five sense perceptions are visual perception etc. These are produced by the  contact of sense organ, sense object, mind and self. They are momentary and deter- minative. This is about five pentads. ",
638,12,
639," Mind, objects of mind, intellect and self are, in brief, the substances and quali- ties pertaining to self. This entire group is the cause of inclination towards and ab- staining from auspicious and inauspicious acts respectively. Action (also) known as  therepeutic measures is dependent on substance. ",
640,13,
641," Among the existent sense organs which are comprehensible by inference and are  composed of combination of the resultants of five mahabhutas-the visual, auditory,  olfactory, gustatory and tactile organs-have predominance of tejas, akasa, prthivT, ap  and vayu respectively. Thus the sense organs perceive the respective objects accord- ing to predominance of their constituent mahabhuta, because of their similarity of  nature and (specific) capability (for sense perception). ",
642,14,
643," In case of the sense organs alongwith the mind having been deranged due to  excessive, negative and perverted conjuction with their sense objects, the respective  sense preception gets disturbed. Again with their balanced use when all this returns to  normalcy, it promotes the respective sense perception. ",
644,15,
645," The object of mind is that which can be thought of. The balanced, excessive,  negative and perverted conjuctions are the causes of normalcy and abnormality of  mind and its sense perception. ",
646,16,
647, ,
648,page_no:56 ,
649,0,
650," So in order to prevent derangements in sense organs alongwith mind one should  make effort to maintain the normalcy by these methods-such as, with conjuction of  wholesome sense objects one should perform acts well properly and invariably exam- ining with intellect, and also by regular use of those which are opposite to the quali- ties of place, time and self. Hence, one who desires to promote his own well-being  should follow the entire code of good conduct fully, invariably and cautiously. ",
651,17,
652," That, if practised, fulfils two objectives simultaneously-health and control  One should worship gods, cow, brahmanas, preceptors, elderly people,  accomplished and teachers.

697,34,
698, Thus ends the eighth chapter on introductory description of sense organs  in Slokasthana in the treatise composed by Agnivesa and  redacted by Caraka (8). Here ends the second quaduplet on the healthy (2) CHAPTER IX Now (I) shall expound the chapter on small quadruped. (1) ffit f  FfTf 1 1  9 1 1 As propounded by Lord Atreya ,

701,3,
702, Abnormality (disorder) is disequilibrium of dhatus and their equilibrium is  normalcy (health). Health is known as happiness while disorder is unhappiness. ,
703,4,
704, Employment of all the excellent four-physician etc.-in case of disorder of dhatus  with the object of (re-establishing) their equilibrium is said as therapeutics. ,

714,8,
715," Memory, obedience, fearlessness and providing all information about the disor-  der-these are the qualities of a patient. ",
716,9,
717," This quadruped consisting of sixteen qualities is the cause of success but here  also the physician is the main because of his having specific knowledge, administra- tive and managing positions. ",
718,10,
719," As in the act of cooking, utensils, fuel and fire and in victory of the victorious  land, army and weapons are causative factors, similarly, in the success of a physician  in treatment (of disorders) patients etc, are mentioned as causative factors. Thus the  physician is the principal cause. ",
720,12-Nov,
721,"  As earth, stick, wheel, thread etc. do not serve the purpose (of making a pitcher)  without the potter, the other three legs are in the same position without the  physician. ",
722,13,
723,"  I That extremely severe disorders vanish like the (imaginary) city of gandharvas  and even simplest disorders aggravate in want of quick management in spite of the  three other legs being existent, confirms that the learned and the ignorant physicians  are responsible for the above two consequences respectively. ",

On the other hand, there are  patients who, in spite of the lack of necessary materials, attendants, patience and ex- pert medical service, recover, while others in similar condition die. As while being  treated patient recovers and (in similar condition) other dies; and even while not be- ing treated he recovers and (in similar condition) other dies.

For intance, when somebody helps a fallen person, even if he himself is able to get  up, he stands up more quickly and easily. Likewise, the patients recover with  administration of total therapy. In case of the patients who die even after the total  therapy, they all are not liable to recovery after therapeutic administration because  all deseases are not curable by therapeutic measures. On one side, there is no cure  of curable diseases without applying therapeutic measures and, on the other side,  the therapeutics has no role in case of incurable diseases, even a learned physician is  not capable to arouse a dying patient. Hence the skillful people always act after  careful examination (of the situation). As an archer having theoretical knowledge  and practical experience in the art, does not fail when he takes the bow and strikes  the arrow to a not distant and big object and thus achieves the desired result, like- wise, the physician, endowed with his qualities and equipped with all necessary  materials, proceeds with treatment (of the patient) after careful examination, ",

792,2,
793," A person, having underanged mind, intellect, potency and prowess and looking  to his well-being here and in the world hereafter, should pursue three desires such as  desire for life, desire for wealth and desire for the other world. ",
794,3,
795," on departure of life, everything departs. That can be maintained by observance of the  code of conduct for the healthy and non-carelessness in alleviation of disorders in the  diseased. Both these have been said (in part) and will be said further. Following the  aforesaid path, by maintaining the vital power, one achieves long life. Thus desire for  life is described. ",

800," Hereafter, one should pursue the desire for wealth. Next to life, it is wealth  which is to be sought. There is nothing more sinful than to have a long life without  means (of maintenance). Hence one should make effort to achieve these means, the  methods for which are mentioned here such as-agriculture, animal husbandry, trade  and commerce, government service etc. and other such works which are not discarded  by noble persons and are promoters of livelihood-such works one should start doing.  By working in this way one lives a long life without any dishonour. Thus the second  desire for wealth is explained. ",
801,5,
802," Now one should pursue the third desire for the other world. Here is doubt,  The background of such doubt is that some scholars devoted to perception only have  accepted nihilism because rebirth is imperceptible while others hold rebirth only on  evidence of scriptures. Then, there is also difference of opinion among the scriptures  such as- 'Some consider parents as the cause of birth while others hold nature, creation by  other (creator) and chance as the same'. Hence it is doubtful whether there is rebirth  or not. ",
803,6,
804," Here, the wise person should give up nihilistic approach and also vascillation.  ptible is large which is known by scriptures, inference and reasoning.  Moreover, the sense organs which are instruments of perception, are themselves  imperceptible. ",
805,7,
806, ,
807,page_no:71 ,
808,0,
809," Even the existing forms can't be known by perception due to various factors  such as excessive nearness, too much distance, covering, inability of sense organs,  instability of mind, mixing up with similar objects, over-shadowing and excessive  minuteness. Hence it is illogical to say that only perception is there and nothing  else. ",
810,8,
811," i, I The (divergent) scriptures too can not stand because of contradiction to reason- ing. If the self of the parents migrates to the progeny, it may go either wholly or  partly. In case, it goes wholly, the parents should die invariably and as regards the  other alternative, there can not be any part of the subtle self. ",
812,10-Sep,
813," As in case of self, decision may be taken in cases of intellect and mind too (of the  parents being responsible for birth). Moreover, in the opinion of people having such  view, there can not be fourfold categories of (moving ones). ",
814,11,
815," Though specific characters of the nature of six dhatus are there, their conjunc- tion and disjunction (responsible for birth and death respectively) depend upon the  causation of action (of atman). ",
816,12,
817, Creation of beginningless and sustainer of concsiousness (self) by some other  (creator) does not look logical. If the word â€™ paraâ€™  means 'atman' himself then this may  be accepted as the cause (of creation). ,
818,13,
819," For the negativist whose consciousness has been injured by (accepting) the theory  of chance, there is no examination, one to be examined, doer, cause, gods, sages,  accomplished persons, action, result of action and also the self. This holding up of  negativism is the worst among sinful. ",
820,14-15,

One can infer hidden fire from smoke, sexual intercourse from observing  the foetus and the future fruit from seed. By observing the bearing of similar fruit, the  learned infer the causation of seed. ",
833,21-22,
834," I The growth of crops is observed from combination of water, ploughing, seed and  climate and so is the growth of foetus from combination of six dhatus. This is  (possible only because of) yukti-(proper and rational combination of all constituent  factors). Similar is the case of production of fire from the combination of one to  be churned, churning (process) and the churning stick. So is the arrangement of  four limbs (of therapeutics) which alleviates diseases if combined and used ration- ally. ",
835,23-24,

From the authoritative scripture it is known that charity, penance, religious  sacrifice, truthfulness, non-violence and celibacy lead to worldly prosprity and lib- eration. ",

847," Rebirth has been established on perceiving with divine vision by early and  earlier great sages who were devoted to religious scriptures, are devoid of fear,  attachment, aversion, greed, confusion and conceit; devoted to ultimate know- ledge, endowed with authoritative knowledge, having practical experience and like that. ",
848,29,
849," By perception also it is observed-progeny dissimilar to parents, difference in  complexion, voice, physiognomy, mind, intellect and fate inspite of the similar  genetic source, birth in a superior and inferior clan, slavery and sovereignty, happy  and unhappy life, inequality in life span, achievement of the result of the deed here,  inclination of untrained (babies) to weeping, breast-suckling, laughing, fear etc., ap- pearance of marks (in body parts), difference in result inspite of similarity in action,having movement of mind and intellect quite underatged.

854," On the same basis, it is inferred that the deed of the self is unavoidable,  undestructible, related to previous body and continuing is known as â€™daivaâ€™  (fate).  This (rebirth) is result of that (deed). Hereafter another (birth) would also be these  seed is inferred from fruit and vice versa. ",
855,31,
856," Rationale is also there-foetus is formed by combination of six dhatus, action is  due to conjunction of doer and instrument, result comes out of the action performed  and not of unperformed, there is no growth of sprout without seed. Result is in  consonance with action, no another (plant) grows from another seed. This is ration- ale. ",
857,32,
858," Thus, re-birth having been established by (all) the four means of correct knowl- edge, one should attend to religious scriptures (and duties prescribed by them) such  as service of the teacher, study, performance of rites, marriage, reproduction,  supporting servants intertaining guests, charity, refraining from desire of taking  (another's property), penance, refraining from envy, benevolent acts of body, speech  and mind, constant examination of body, sense organs, mind, objects, intellect and  self and also concentration of mind. One should also take up such other works which  are undespised by noble persons, heavenly and which promote livelihood. Acting so  one attains fame here and heaven hereafter. Thus the third desire for the other world  is explained. ",

866,35,
867," Strength is of three types-congenital, time-effected and acquired. Congenital  is that which is natural to the body and mind; time-effected is due to seasonal varia- tions and age factor. Acquired one is produced by proper application of diet and  exercise. ",

Such as-excessive gazing at the overbrilliant  object is excessive use, avoiding looking altogether is negative use and seeing too  near, too distant, fierce, frightful, wonderful, disliked, disgusting, deformed and  terrifying objects is perverted use of visual objects. Likewise, to hear too much the  loud sound of clouds, drums, cries etc. is excessive use; not at all hearing is negative  use and hearing of harsh and frightful words and those which indicate death of  dear ones, loss, humiliation etc. is perverted use of auditory objects. Too much  smelling of too sharp, intense and congestant odors is excessive use, not at all  smelling is negative use and smelling of foetid, disliked, impure, decomposed, poi- soned air, cadaveraceous odour etc. is perverted use of olfactory objects, Likewise,  too much intake of rasas (tastes) is excessive use, not at all taking is negative use of  gustatory objects.

873,37,
874,"Out of all the senses, the tactile sense alone pervades all the sense organs and is  also associated inherently with mind so due to pervading of tactile sense, mind also  pervades.

The  objects which are accepted suitably are known as wholesome ones. ",
875,38,
876," Action is application of speech, mind and body. Too much application of these  is excessive use and their total non-application is negative use. Holding up or forcing  of urges, sleeping, falling and posturing on uneven places, abnormal posturing,  heating, pressing, obstructing breath and torturing is the perverted use of bodily  actions, words indicating betrayal, lying, untimely speech, quarrel, unliking,  irrelevance, indiscipline and harshness etc. come under the perverted uses of speech;  fear, grief, anger, greed, confusion, conciet, envy, wrong knowledge is the perverted  use of mind.

Time is again known as consequence. ",

The fool does not realise till he is afflicted and only there- after he thinks for controlling the disease. Then he collects son, wife and kins and  requests them to bring some physician even at the cost of his entire possession, but  who can be able to save him, the devoid of life, weak, afflicted, emaciated, anxious  and with the sense organs waned away.

That vayu gets vitiated due to prolonged use of  measures having similar properties, substances and effects because prolonged use of  similar properties is the cause of increase in dhatus. ",
930,5,
931," Having heard this, Kankayana, the physician from Bahllka, said-this is as you  said, those very factors are the vitiating causes of vata and those having opposite  properties are the pacifying factors as the opposite to vitiating (factors) is the cause  of pacification of dhatus. ",
932,6,
933,"  Having heard this, Badisa Dhamargava said-you have said correctly, sir,  these are ver'ly the factors vitiating or pacifying vata. Now I am explaining how  these (factors) without coming in contact with the formless and unstable vata  exert their vitiating or pacifying action. The vata-vitiating factors produce roughness, 16 C.

936," lightness, coldness, hardness, coarseness, non-sliminess and hollowness in the body  parts and vayu finding favourable environment there gets located in those body  parts and because of nourishment gets vitiated. On the contrary, the vata-pacifying  factors produce unctuousness, heaviness, hotness, smoothness, softness, sliminess and  solidity. Thus vayu moving in such body parts finds no location and as such gets  pacified. ",
937,7,
938," Having heard the correct statement as approved by the groups of sages, the  royal sage. Varyovida said-this is all free from fallacy as you said, sir. Now I shall  describe, as far as possible, after bowing to (Lord) Vayu and confirming each item  by perception, inference and authoritative sources, the effects of Vayu-vitiated or  unvitiated, manifested in or outside the body. Vayu, when unvitiated, holds up the systems and organs, has five forms-  prana, udana, samana, vyana and apana, initiates upward and downward move- ments, leads and controls mind, employs all sense organs in their activity, carries  all sense objects, causes structural formation of all bodily dhatus, promotes union in ",

941," body, prompts speech, originates touch and sound, is the root of auditory and tactile  sense organs, is source of exhilaration and courage, stimulates agni (digestion), ab- sorbs dosas, throws out excreta, makes the gross and subtle channels, shapes the  foetus and maintains life span. When it is vitiated in the body, it afflicts it with various disorders and thereby  affects strength, complexion, happiness and life-span; agitates mind, affects all the  sense organs, destroys, deforms or detains the embryo for long, produces fear, grief,  confusion, anxiety and excessive delirium and (at the end) stops the vital breath. The normal vayu, moving about in the nature performs these functions-holding  up the earth, kindling of fire, disposing continuous movement of the sun, the moon  and groups of stars and planets, making of clouds, raining waters, initiation of streams,  producing flowers and fruits, sprouting of plants, demarcation of seasons, division of  dhatus, manifesting the measure and shape of dhatus, strengthening of seeds, growth  of plants, removing excessive moisture, absorbing and normal transformation. When it moves about in nature in the vitiated condition it shows these effects-  churning the tops of mountains, churning of trees, producing high tides in oceans,  overflowing of the lakes, counter-current in rivers, earthquake, moving of clouds with  sound, showering of dew, thunder, dust, sand, fish, frog, snake, alkali, blood, stone  and thunderstorm; derangement of six seasons, non-compactness of crops, complica- tions in creatures, replacing the positive factors with negative ones and release of  clouds, sun, fire and wind which bring about the end of four ages. Vayu is all powerful, producer and indestructible; causes negation of the posi- tive factors in creatures and brings about happiness and misery; he is Death, Yama  (god of death), regulator, Prajapati (master of the creatures), Aditi, Viswa, karma  (performing all sorts of functions), taking all sorts of forms, penetrates into all executes  all the systems is ,subtle among the things, is pervasive, Visnu (protector)moves in the  entire nature, what else Vayu himself is the Lord (all powerful).

946," Varyovida replied-If a physician does not realise the (importance of) vayu which  is too strong, too rough, too quick-acting and causing emergent conditions, how  would he be able to protect further aggravation of suddenly vitiated vayu, inspite of  best efforts, or prior to this to prevent the emergency. The sincere regard to vayu,  too, is conductive to health, improvement of strength and complexion, valour,  development, improvement of knowledge and maximum expanse of life-span. ",
947,10,
948," MarTci said-Agni itself which is included in pitta in the body is responsible for  producing wholesome or unwholesome effects in vitiated or unvitiated states respec- tively. Such as-digestion-indigestion, vision-nonvision, (proper) degree or otherwise  of heat, normal-abnormal complexion, prowess-fear, anger-exhilaration, confusion  and clarity and other such duals. ",
949,11,
950," Having heard the statement of MarTci, Kapya said-It is soma which included in  kapha gives rise to good or bad effects in vitiated or unvitiated condition respec- tively, such as firmness-laxity, development-emaciation, enthusiasm and idleness,  potency-impotency, knowledge-ingorance, understanding-confusion and other such  duals. ",
951,12,
952," Having heard the statement of Kapya, Lord Punarvasu Atreya said-All of you  have said correctly except non-exclusive statement. All vata, pitta and kapha, in nor- mal state, endow the person with unaffected sense organs, strength, complexion and  happiness and also with a long life-span as virtue, wealth and enjoyment pursued  properly endow the person with great well-being here and in the world hereafter; on  the contrary, in abnormal state, they give rise to severe abnormalities as three seasons,  when abnormal, produce harmful effects in the world particularly at the time of final  destruction.

This dose is hardly liable to complication,  does not cause too much weakness, uncts with ease. This is used for evacuation. The  old, the children, the delicate, the ease-living, those for which the empty bowels are  not beneficial, have low digestion and are suffering from chronic fever, diarrohea and  cough, have poor strength, should take the low dose of unction. This is easy in pre- cautions, is unctuous and nourishing, promotes virility and strength, is free from com- plication and continues for long. ",

He gets purgation after  drinking hot water or fresh wine. But these do not have purgative effect in those hav- ing hard bowels because in them the grahanT (intestines) contains aggravated vata.

1048," In persons with intestines having excessive pitta and strong digestive power, the  uncting substance taken is reduced to ashes in a very short time by the power of di- gestive fire. The fire fanned by unction and being powerful having consumed the  dose of the unction, affects the ojas and gives rise to complicated thirst. Even much  heavy food is not able to pacify the fire (fuelled and) intensified with unction. If the  person does not get cold water, he is burnt like a serpent lying within a room by his  own poison-fire. If there arises thirst on indigestion of the unction, the physician should induce  vomiting. Again the patient should drink cold water and rough food and then vomit.  Ghee alone should not be taken in (excess of) pitta particularly associated with ama  because it produces colour (jaundice) in the whole body and having destroyed con- sciousness kills (the patient). Drowsiness, nausea, hardness of bowels, fever, stiffness, loss of consciousness,  skin disorders, itching, paleness, oedema, piles, anorexia, thirst, abdominal enlarge- ment, disorders of grahanl, feeling of cold, obstruction in voice, colic pain and disor- ders of ama-these arise due to improper unction. There, frequent vomiting, fomentation, watching for a while and purgation are  recommended according to severity of disease. The use of buttermilk, arista (a fer- mented preparation) rough food and drinks, urines and three fruits is the remedy for  complications due to unction (or hyperlipidaemia). ",

1059," In case of those having aversion to uncting substance, habit of unction, soft  bowels, intolerance for physical strain and habit of drinking, uncting media are rec- ommended. The meat soup of common-quail, black partridge, peacock, swan, pig, cock,  cow, goat, wild sheep and fish are useful in unction. Barley, jujube, kulattha (horse  gram), uncting substances mixed with jaggery and sugar, pomegranates, curd and  the three pungent (long pepper, ginger and black pepper)-these are combined with  the above soup. The sesamum seeds if taken alongwith the uncting substance and  phanita (a sort of jaggery) before meals produce good unction. Similar is the effect  of krsara (a dietary preparation of rice and pulse) with plenty of uncting substance  and of tilakambalika (a dietary preparation). One, who is affected with roughness, should take phanita (a sort of jaggery),  ginger and oil together with wine. After it is digested he should take meal alongwith  minced meat. The person having predominance of vata is uncted by taking oil, fat or  marrow alongwith clear wine or milk mixed with phanita (a sort of jaggery). A person  is uncted by taking fresh warm milk mixed with the uncting substance and sugar or  the upper fatty layer of curd together with phanita. The liquid gruel known  as pancaprasrtikT and payasa (rice cooked with milk) mixed with black gram, cooked  in milk and added with plenty of the uncting substance uncts the person in a  short time. PancaprasrtikT gruel is prepared from five items (ghee, oil, fat, marrow  and rice) each in prasrta (80 gm.) quantity. This gruel should be taken by one desiring  unction. ",

By  application of fomentation, prior unction having been done, vata is won over and thus  faeces, urine and semen are never obstructed. Even the dry pieces of wood bend after   proper application of oil and heat then what is to be said about the living human   Fomentation is said as effective if applied with consideration of disease, season   and the diseased; is not too hot or too mild, combined with proper drugs and arranged   in proper place.

This is also administered  with faeces of cow, ass, camel, pig and horse, husked barley, sand, dust, stone pieces,  dried cow dung and iron balls.

The therapy is administered with the objective that there should not be disequilibrium  in dhatus and that there should be promotion of dhatus which are in equilibrium. By  abstaining from the factors causing disequilibrium and pursuing those causing equi- librium, the imbalanced ones are produced. As the well-equipped physician leads to  production of balanced dhatus by means of balanced factors, he is regarded as donor  of health, happiness and longevity.

1280, As propounded by Lord Atreya. ,
1281,2,
1282," Having heard the questions of AgniveSa, the preceptor (Lord Atreya) said-  O gentle, hear my detailed reply to your questions. Five are the head diseases  and also the heart diseases. There are sixty two disorders which arise due to pro- ",

1286,7-Mar,
1287," Suppression of urges, day-sleep, night vigil, narcosis, loud speech, dew, easterly  wind, excessive sexual intercourse, inhalation of unsuitable smell, exposure to dust,  smoke, snow and the sun, intake of heavy, sour and salads, drinking of too much cold  water, head injury, vitiated ama, weeping, suppression of tears, clouds, mental abnor- mality, use of those unsuitable for place and time-these factors vitiate vata etc. and  also blood in the head which produce various types of diseases in head.

1291," Pain in half or entire head, coryza, disorders of mouth, nose, eyes and ear, giddi- ness, facial paralysis, tremors in head, stiffness, in back neck and jaws and other  various disorders due to vata etc. (dosas) and krimis (organisms). ",
1292,13-14,
1293," Now listen about the five head diseases alongwith causes and symptoms as  said earlier by the great sages. Due to loud and too much speech, sharp drinks,  vigil, contact with cold wind, sexual intercourse, suppression of urges, fasting,  injury, excessive vomiting and purgation, tears, grief, fear and anxiety; excessive  exhaustion due to weight-carrying and travelling on foot vayu gets aggravated  and vitiated and entering into the cranial veins produces these symptoms. There  is intense pain due to vata particularly in temporal regions and nape, middle of  the eyebrows and forehead have burning sensation and excessive pain. There is dizzi- ",

The patient gets relief from unctuous and hot applica- tions. This is about head diseases caused by vata. ",
1297,15-21,
1298," By (excessive) use of pungent, sour, salt, alkali, wines, by anger and over  exposure to the sun and fire, pitta gets vitiated and being located in head produces  head diseases. Because of this, the head as if burns and has pain and is pacified  by cold. The eyes have burning sensation and there are thirst, giddiness and perspira- tion. ",
1299,22-23,
1300," Due to sedentary habits, too much sleep, over intake of heavy and unctuous  diet, kapha is vitiated and causes head diseases. In this the head has dull pain,  numbness, cold sensation and heaviness. There are also drowsiness, lassitude and  anorexia. ",
1301,24-25,
1302," In head diseases caused by all the three dosas, there are pain, giddiness and  tremors due to vata; burning sensation, narcosis and thirst due to pitta and heaviness  and drowsiness due to kapha. ",
1303,26,
1304,"  By (excessive) intake of tila, milk, jaggery; eating during indigestion, putrified  and mixed up food in those having abundance of dosas, excessive moisture arise in  bloody kapha and muscles. Then due to increase of moisture in head the trouble-  creating organisms cause head disease with loathsome symptoms. One should  diagnose the case of krimiroga (worm-affection) by the symptoms-piercing and  cutting pain, functional disorders, itching, swelling, difficulty in movement-by  observing the worms. ",

1310,30-31,
1311," Hot, sour, salty, alkaline and pungent food, eating during indigestion, wines,  anger and the sun vitiate the pitta in the heart. In this pittaja heart disease, these  symptoms appear-burning sensation in cardiac region, bitterness in mouth, bitter  and sour eructation, exhaustion, thirst, fainting, giddiness and perspiration. ",
1312,32-33,
1313," Kaphaja heart disease is caused by excessive intake, use of heavy and unctuous  substances, little mental and physical work and indulgence in sleep. In this the patient  suffers from drowsiness and anorexia and feeling of numbness, cold and weight in  the cardiac region as if it is pressed with stone. ",
1314,34-35,
1315," When causative factors and symptoms of all the dosas are combined together it  is sannipatika (produced by combination of all the three dosas). (Heart disease is troublesome and hardly curable as said by the great sages). The evil-natured who takes sesamum, milk, jaggery etc. in the heart disease  caused by all the three dosas, suffers from a gland appearing in a portion of the  heart. Moreover, his rasadhatu attains moisture in a portion of the vital organ due to  which organisms develop, spread in the region and lead to decay of the heart. The  patient feels pain as if the heart is pierced by needles or cut by weapons, itching and  intense pain. Diagnosing the case as krimija hrdroga (heart disease caused by  organisms) on the basis of the above symptoms one should take immediate steps to  overcome the disorder which is emergent as well as severe.

Likewise, the diminution on dosas is also of twenty  five types making the number as fifty. Conditions of taking aggravation and diminu- tion of dosas together come to twelve. Such as (a) one aggravated, one normal, one  diminished (6), (b) two aggravated, one diminished (3), (c) one aggravated, two di- minished (3). Thus dosas can combine together in various proportions which come to the total  number of sixty two as explained above. ",
1321,41-44,
1322," When, in the event of diminution of kapha, vata carries away the normal pitta  from its location, it produces unstable tearing pain, burning sensation in those organs  wherever it spreads alongwith fatigue and debility. When in the state of diminution of pitta, the dominant vata drags on kapha, it  causes pain, cold sensation, stiffness and heaviness. When pitta, in diminution of kapha,  obstructs the normal vata burning sensation arises. When pitta, in diminution of vata, blocks the normal kapha, it produces drowsi- ness, heaviness and fever. When aggravated kapha, in diminution of pitta, creates obstruction to vata, it  produces shivering, heaviness and fever. ",
1323,page_no:119 ,
1324,0,
1325," When kapha, in the event of diminution of vata, obstructs the normal pitta, it  causes mildness of appetite, stiffness of head, sleep, drowsiness, delirium, heart dis- ease, heaviness in body, yellowness of nails etc., spitting of mucus and bile. When vata is diminished and kapha moves alongwith pitta, it produces anorexia,  indigestion, malaise, heaviness, fatigue, nausea, salivation, paleness, distress, narco- sis, irregularity in purgation and digestion. When pitta is diminished and kapha combines with vata, it causes unstable stiff- ness, cold and piercing pain, heaviness, mildness of digestion, non-inclination to food,  trembling, whiteness of nail etc. and coarseness of body parts. When kapha is diminished and both vata and pitta are agrravated, it produces  giddiness, cramps, piercing pain, burning sensation, cracking, trembling, bodyache,  wasting, distress and fuming. In diminution of vata and pitta, kapha, blocking up the channels, produces loss of  movement, fainting and difficulty in speech. In diminution of vata and kapha, pitta dislocates the ojas and produces malaise,  weakness in sense organs, thirst, fainting and loss of function. In diminution of pitta and kapha, vata produces severe pain in vital organs, loss  of sensation or tembling. ",
1326,45-61,
1327," Dosas, if aggravated, show their symptoms according to the strength; if  diminished, give up their normal character and if normal, perform their functions  properly.",
1328,62,
1329," Now the symptoms of diminution of vata etc. (dosas), rasa etc. (dhatus), malas  and ojas will be described. The symptoms of diminished vata etc. have already been  mentioned. (Now the remaining ones are described). In diminution of rasa, the patient stirs about, does not tolerate loud sound, even  on slight exertion his heart palpitates, aches and (even) fails. ",

1332," In dim inution of rakta (blood)-the skin becomes coarse, cracked and  lustreless. In diminution of mamsa (muscle)-there is obvious emaciation of buttocks, neck  and abdomen. In diminution of medas (fat)-there is cracking of joints, anxious expression,  exhaustion and thin abdomen. In diminution of asthi (bone), there is falling of hairs, nails, beards and mustaches  and teeth, fatigue and laxity of joints. In diminution of majja, the bones are weakened and light as if decaying. They  are also always affected with vatic disorders. In diminution of semen, debility, dryness of mouth, paleness, malaise, fatigue,  impotency and non-ejaculation of semen are the symptoms. In diminution of faeces, vata as if pressing the intestines and lifting the belly  upwards moves obliquely and upwards. In diminution of urine, there are dysuria, abnormal colours in urine, excessive  thirst and dryness of mouth. In case of diminution of other malas, the respective excretory passages become  vacant, light and over-dried up. ",
1333,63-72,
1334," When the ojas is diminished, the person is fearful, weak, always worried,  having disorders in sense organs, deranged lustre and mental ability, rough and  emaciated. The substance of white or red, slightly yellowish colour which resides in heart is  known as ojas. The person dies if it is destroyed. In the body of living beings the  ojas is produced first. This has the colour of ghee, taste of honey and smell of fried  paddy.",
1335,73-75,
1336," (As the bees collect honey from the fruits and flowers, organs of the persons  constitute the ojas with their activities.

It shows the symptoms of vata, pitta and kapha  now and then after diminution again develops. If it is overlooked seven severe pidakas  (boils) arise in muscular areas, vital parts and joints. ",
1342,78-82,
1343," These pidakas (boils) are seven-saravika, kacchapika, jalinl, sarsapl, vinata and  vidradhi. The saravika type of boils is raised at margins, depressed in centre, blackish in  colour, has moisture and pain and looks like an earthen saucer. The kacchapika type has deeper pain particularly of piercing nature, covers a  wide area, is smooth and similar to the back of tortoise. The jalinl type of boil is stiff, has venous network, unctuous discharge, big base,  excessive pain particularly of piercing nature and minute openings. The sarsapl type is not very big, quickly suppurating, very painful and having  mustard-like (small) boils. The alajT type of boil, at the time of appearance, causes burning sensation in  skin, thirst, fainting and fever; spreads over and constantly produces terrible burning  pain like fire. The vinata type of boil has deep pain and thick discharge, appears in back or  abdomen, is big, depressed and blue. ",

1348," Vidradhi (abscess) is of two types-external and internal. The external one is  located in skin, ligament and muscle, resembles tendon and is very painful. By intake of winter cereals, burning, hot, rough and dry food, taking antagonis- tic, during indigestion, mixed up, irregularly and unwholesome diet; drinking  damaged and plenty of wine, suppression of urges, fatigue, complicated physical  exercise and sleep, excessive weight-carrying, travelling on foot and sexual inter- course; when dosas in body affect the mamsa and rakta, deep-seated, painful and  severe gland like node appears in cardiac region, kloman, liver, spleen, lumbar  region, kidneys, navel, groins or urinary bladder. Because of having impure blood in  abundance it gets quickly inflamed and that is why it is called as vidradhi (that causes  vidaha-inflammation). In vidradhi predominant in vata, perforating and cutting pain,  giddiness, distension, sound, throbbing and spreading characters are there. In paittika  type, thirst, burning sensation, fainting, narcosis and fever while in kaphaja type yawn- ing, nausea, anorexia, stiffness and shivering are there. In all types of abscess,  intense pain is the main symptom. The pain may be of various natures such as cutting,  burning or stinging. (As regards the character of discharge), it is thin, rough, reddish  or blackish and foamy in vatika vidradhi; resembling soup of sesamum, black gram  and kulattha in paittika vidradhi and white, slimy, thick and abundant in kaphaja  vidradhi. The sannipatika type (caused by the combination of all the three dosas) has  got all the above symptoms. ",
1349,99-100,
1350," Now (I) shall tell about the particular symptoms according to location of  vidradhis for the knowledge of prognosis. In vidradhi located in the main vital  organ (heart), there will be palpitation, feeling of darkness before eyes, cough  and dyspnoea; in that located in kloman, there will be thirst, dryness of mouth and ",

In liver abscess dyspnoea, in spleen abscess difficult inspira- tion, in abscess developed in lumbar region of abdomen pain in sides of abdomen,  chest and scapular region; in renal abscess stiffness in back and waist, in umbilical  abscess hiccup, in groin abscess weakness in legs and in bladder abscess difficulty  and foul odour in urine and faeces is the characteristic symptom. ",
1354,101,
1355," In abscesses located in upper parts, when they ripen and burst the discharge comes  out of the mouth; in those located in lower parts from anus and in those located in  navel the discharge comes out of both ends. ",
1356,102,
1357," Amongst them, the abscesses located in cardiac region, navel and urinary blad- der, those ripened and caused by all the three dosas are fatal. The remaining can be  amenable to treatment if some expert and swift-handed physician is found. Hence  recently appeared abscess should be treated immediately with unction and purgation  because it is (disastrous) like weapon, serpent, lightening and fire. The treatment is  followed on the lines for that in gulma. ",
1358,103,
1359," didâ€” Here are (the verses)- These boils arise even without prameha (diabetes) in persons with deranged medas  (fat), they do not come to notice till they acquire a large area. Saravika, kacchapika and jalinl types of boils are hardly tolerable and severe and  arise in person having abundance of kapha and medas. On the other hand, sarsapi,  alajl, vinata and vidradhi are curable ones. They are dominant in pitta and occur in  persons with little medas. The diabetic who develops boils in vital organs, shoulder, anus, hands, breast,  joints and feet does not survive. ",

1364," (Apart from these) there are other types of boils such as those having red, yel- low, black, reddish, pale, yellowish, ash-like and deep black colour. Some are soft  while others are hard; some are big while some are small; some of them are slow-  growing while others are fast-growing; some are mildly painful while others are in- tensely painful. After observing them, one should diagnose according to the respec- tive causes and symptoms of vata etc. and treat them immediately before complica- tion develops. Thus, dyspnoea, gangrene, fainting, hiccup, narcosis, fever, metastasis  and obstruction in vital organs-these are the complications of boils. ",
1365,108-111,
1366," Diminution, normalcy and aggravation are three types of movement of dosas.  The other threefold movement is upward downward and oblique and the other three  types are movement in belly, extremitis (dhatus) and marmasthi-sandhi (vital organs  and bone joints). Thus threefold movement of dosas is said. Accumulation, vitiation and pacification of pitta, kapha and vata occurs in sea- sons of rains etc. respectively1 . Thus conditioning is natural by the effect of seasonal  changes. ",
1367,112-114,
1368," Again, movement (of dosas) is of two types-normal and abnormal. For instance,  when vitiated it causes many disorders. Kapha, in normal state, is (responsible  for) strength but when abnormal becomes excretion. In other words, the normal  kapha is said as ojas while the abnormal one is sinful (cause of various disorders).  Likewise, all the movements are due to (normal) vata and it is taken as life breath  of the living beings but in abnormal state it produces disorders even obstructing the  life breath. ",

1370," 1 1. Pitta is accumulated, vitiated and pacified in rainy season, autumn and early winter re- spectively. Kapha is accumulated, vitiated and pacified in early winter, spring and sum- mer respectively. Vata is accumulated, vitiated and pacified in summer, rainy season and   autumn respectively. ",

1382,3,

1387,4,
1388,"  They are known, in the beginning, by their respective etiology and symptoms  which differ from innate symptoms partly. These (exogenous swellings) subside when  treated with bandage, mantras, anti-toxic drugs, pastes, heating and cooling etc. ",
1389,5,
1390," Innate swellings are caused by improper administration of unction, fomentation,  emesis, purgation, non-unctuouous and unctuous enema and head evacuation or im- proper dietitic regimen after evacuative therapy or excessive emaciation consequent  to diseases like vomiting, alasaka, cholera, dyspnoea, cough, diarrhoea, phthisis, anae- mia, abdominal enlargement, fever, excessive vaginal discharges, fistula-in-ano and  piles or due to leprosy (skin diseases), itching, boils etc. or by suppression of natural  urges as of vomiting, sneezing, eructation, semen, wind, urine and faeces or in the  debilitated after evacuative therapy, diseases, fasting or travelling on foot, by sudden  intake of too heavy, sour, saltish, preparations of (rice) flour, fruit, vegetables, pick- les, curd, salads, wines, imperfect curd, germinated or fresh awned and leguminons  grains and marshy and aguatic animals, by eating earth, mud or brick; by excessive  intake of salt, by compression of foetus, abortion or improper postpartum manage- ment or due to aggravation of dosas.

1395," Vayu, vitiated by cold, rough, light, non-slimy substance, faligue, fasting, ex- cessive emaciation and wasting etc. overcoming the twak, mamsa, rakta etc. produces  swelling. This is quickly arising and subsiding. The part affected becomes blackish or  reddish or has normal complexion, moving, pulsating, with skin and hair coarse, rough  and broken. The person feels that part as if excised, incised, pressed, pierced with  needles, crawled over by ants, has irritating sensation as if pasted with mustard, con- tracts or expands. This is (the character of) vata sotha (swelling due to vata). (1); Pitta, vitiated with intake of hot, sharp, pungent, alkaline, salt, sour food and  eating during indigestion, and heating with fire and the sun, overcomes the twak,  mamsa and rakta and thus produces swelling. It quickly arises and subsides. The part  affect has black, yellow, blue and coppery tinge, hot, soft and with brown and cop- pery hairs. It has burning sensations of various natures, is hot, perspiring, moist and  likes the contact of hot things. Thus is (character of) pitta sotha (swelling due to  pitta). (2); Kapha, vitiated by use of heavy, sweet, cold and unctous food; over sleep and  absence of exercise etc., overcomes twak, mamsa, rakta etc. and thus produces swell- ing. It arises and subsides with difficulty. The part affected is pale, unctuous, smooth,  stable, thick, with white hair tips and tolerant of touch and heat. This is (the charactor  of) kapha-sotha (swelling due to kapha). (3) By combination of respective causes and symptoms dwidosaja (produced by two  dosas combined together) swellings occur which are three in number. Likewise, by  combination of respective causes and symptoms of all the three dosas sannipatika  swelling arises which is only one. Thus swelling is of seven types. ",
1396,7,
1397," From various points of view, swelling is two types (innate and exogenous),  of three types (caused by three dosas separately), of four types (caused by three  dosas and one exogenous), of seven types (caused by three dosas separately (3)+ by  combination of two dosas (3) + by combination of three dosas (1)=, of eight types  (above seven and one exogenous) but basically, swelling is one having protuberance  in common.

The swelling which is reddish subsides  in night and also by unctuous and hot massage is of vatika type. In paitika swelling, the patient suffers from thirst and fever, the part has burning  pain, perspiration, moisture and smell. It starts with the middle of the body, the pa- tient has yellow eyes, face and skin, thin skin and diarrhoea. Cold, immobile, itching, pale swelling which does not rebound after pressure is  of kaphaja type. The swelling which does not bleed on cutting with sharp weapon or  kusa grass but oozes hardly some slimy discharge is also of kaphaja type. Where there  is combination of causes and symptoms of two dosas, it is dwidosaja. The sannipataja  has the combination of causes and symptoms of all the three dosas. ",

1404," The swelling which starts from feet and spreads all over the body is curable hardly  and also the one which starts from the face in women. In men or women, if the swell- ing arises from the genitals, it is mostly difficult to be cured and also the one having  complications. ",

1411," The quickly emerging swelling caused by kapha, vitiated and located at the  tongue root produces upajihvika. The similar swelling cused by kapha, vitiated and located in kakala (uvula) pro- duces galasundika. The vitiated kapha located outside the throat causes swelling slowly which pro- duces galaganda (goitre). When the vitiated kapha, firmly located within the throat causes swelling quickly,  it produces galagraha. When vitiated pitta alongwith rakta spreads in skin it causes swelling with red- ness which produces visarpa (erysipelas). When vitiated pitta is located in skin and rakta, swelling and redness appear which  causes pidaka (boils). When the vitiated pitta goes to rakta and dries up there, it produces tilaka, piplu,  vyanga and nTlika. When the vitiated pitta is located in temporal regions, severe swelling known as  sankhaka is produced. When, at the end of fever, pitta gets vitiated and is located at the roots of the  ears, a severe and fatal swelling arises. When the vitiated vata elevates the spleen producing mild pain in sides, the spleen  enlarges. When the vitiated vayu is located in the regions of gulma causing swelling and  pain, it produces gulma. When the vitiated vayu moves from groins to testicles causing swelling and pain,  it produces vrddhi. 22 C . S.-I ",

1414," When the vitiated vata is located beneath the skin and muscles producing swell- ing in abdomen, it causes udara. When the vitiated vata stays localised in the belly and moves neither upwards  nor downwards, it causes anaha. In the context of swelling, there are other swellings like adhimamsa, arbuda etc.  which have specific names and forms. When all the three dosas aggravate simultaneously and get located at the root  of tongue, they produce intense burning sensation, swelling and various types of  pain, this quickly fatal disease is known as Rohinl. In this the maximum life of  the patient is three days. But if treated by an expert physician one recovers immedi- ately. ",
1415,19-36,
1416,  There are certain curable diseases of severe nature which become fatal in case  they are improperly managed or not given adequate treatment. There are other curable  diseases which are mild and get alleviated certainly with or without effort. There are other incurable diseases known as palliable in which even excellent  treatment enables the patient to move along. While there are other (incurable) dis- eases where even the treatment with much effort provided by the ignorant (physi- cians) does not succeed. The wise (physicians) should not treat them. Thus diseases are of two types-curable and incurable. Again by dividing them  each as mild and severe they become of four types. ,
1417,37-41,
1418," In fact, the diseases are innumerable being divided on the basis of disorder, col- our, etiology, symptoms, and name. Their systematisation has been attempted in the  form of some gross diseases. However, in other cases, general principle may be fol- lowed. ",

1423," The one who can not label a disorder with some name should not feel ashamed  because all disorders have no established footing by name. The reason is that the  same vitiated dosa causes various disorders according to variation in etiology and  location. Hence one should initiate treatment after having complete knowledge about  the nature of the disorder (pathogenesis), locations and etiological factors.

Three types of  leucoderma are-red, coppery and white. Three types of internal haemorrhage are-  upper (from upper parts like mouth, nose etc.) lower (from lower parts like urethra,  anus, and vagina) and both simultaneously from both the above passages including  the hair ducts of skin).

From etiological point of view, they are of two types-exogenous and innate. Their  location is also two-fold-mind and body. But disorders are innumerable because of  innumerable variations in constitution, location, symptoms, etiology and proportion  of causative factors. ",

1500," In all these vatika disorders-said or unsaid-the following natural and specific  characters are observed, finding which wholly or partly, the expert physicians un- doubtedly diagnose them as only the disorders of vata. They are-roughness, coldness,  lightness, non-sliminess, motion, formlessness and instability are the specific char- acters of vata. Vata, having such characters, produces the following actions in re- spective organs when enters into them. Such as separation, dislocation, division,  attachment, tearing, malaise, exhilaration, thirst, tremors, circumvention, looseness,  piercing pain, pain, movement etc. and also coarseness, roughness, non-sliminess,  porousness, reddish lustre, astringent taste and tastelessness, wasting, pain, numbness,  contra-ction, stiffness, limping etc. are the actions of vayu. If these are found in  some disorder that should be diagnosed as vatic one. ",

1502," Vayu is treated with sweet, sour, salted, unctuous and hot therapeutic measures  and also by application of non-unctuous and unctuous enema, snuffing, diet, massage,  annointing, bath etc. in appropriate dose and time. Amongst all of them, non-unctu-  ous and unctuous enema are regarded as the important ones in (the treatment of) vata  because enema enters into the colon shortly and cuts off the entire pathogenic root of  vata. Thus when vata is overcome there, the disorders of vata in other parts of the  body are pacified like the tree when cut at the root gets definite destruction of its  other parts as stem, branches, aerial root, flowers, fruits, leaves etc. ",

Such as-heat, sharpness, fluid- ity, slight unctuousness, colours except white and reddish, fishy smell, pungent and  sour taste and movability-are the specific character of pitta. This sort of pitta exhibits  the following actions in respective parts where it enters into. Such as-burning, heat,  inflammation, perspiration, moisture, sloughing, itching, discharge and redness  alongwith the appearance of respective smell, colour and taste-are the action of pitta,  which, if found, indicate undoubtedly the paittika disorders.

1510,15,
1511," This should be managed with sweet, bitter, astringent and cold measures and also  by application of unction, purgation, pasting, bath, massage etc. which alleviate pitta,  according to proper dose and time. Purgation is regarded as the most important one  amongst all the therapies for pitta by physician because from the very start on enter- ing into the amasaya (location of ama dosa) it extracts the entire pathogenic root of  pitta and when it is overcome, the paittika mainfestations in the body get pacified like  the fire-chamber which becomes cold when the fire is removed.

This sort of kapha exhibits the following actions in respective body  parts when it enters into them such as-whiteness, coldness, itching, immobility, heavi- ness, unctuousness, numbness, moistening, mucous covering, binding, sweetness, and  chronicity are the actions of kapha. The disorders associated with these should be  diagnosed as the kaphaja one. ",
1519,18,
1520," It should be managed with pungent, bitter, astringent, sharp, hot and rough meas- ures and also by the use of fomentation, emesis, snuffing, exercise etc. according to  proper dose and time. Emesis is regarded as the best one among all the therapeutic  measures for kapha, because from the very start on entering the amasaya it propels up  the entire pathogenic root of kapha. When kapha is overcome, the disorders of kapha  in the body get pacified like the crop plants of paddy, barley etc. drying up in absence  of moisture when the obstructing ridge of the field is broken.

1537,3,
1538," Amongst them, the over-obese and the over-lean have other despicable features  too. The over-obese has eight defects-shortening of life-span, hampered movement,  difficulty in sexual intercourse, debility, foul smell, over-sweating, too much hunger  and excessive thirst. Over-obesity is caused by over-saturation, intake of heavy, sweet,  cold and fatty diet, indulgence in day-sleeping and exhilaration, lack of mental work  and genetic defect. There is excess of fat in him and further only fat is accumulated  and not the other dhatus so, thus the life-span is shortened; because of laxity, softness  and heaviness of fat there is hampering in movement; due to non-abundance of semen  and the passage having been covered with fat, there is difficulty in sexual intercourse;  due to disequilibrium of dhatus there is debility; foul smell is due to defect and nature  of fat and also sweating, due to association of medas with kapha, its oozing nature,  abundance, heaviness and intolerance to physical exercise there is over-sweating;  because of intensified agni (digestion) and abundance of vayu in belly there is ex- cessive hunger and thirst.

1543," Here are the verses- Vayu, due to passage having been obstructed with fat, moves about abundantly  in belly and thus stimulates digestion and absorbs food. Hence the person digests  food quickly and desires excessively the intake of food. In case of delay in taking  food he is afflicted with some severe disorders. These two-agni and vayu-are par- ticularly complicating and as such burn the obese like the forest-fire burning the for- est. In the event of excessive increase of fat, vayu etc. (dosas) suddenly give rise to  severe disorders and thus destroy the life shortly. The person is called as over-obese  who, due to excessive increase of fat and muscles, has pendulous buttocks, abdomen  and breasts and suffers from deficient metabolism and energy. Thus described the  defects, cause and symptoms of the obese. ",
1544,9-Mar,
1545," Hereafter, the features of the over-lean will be explained. Indulgence in rough  food and drinks, fasting, little diet, excessive subjection to evacuative therapy, grief,  suppression of natural urges including those of sleep, non-unctuous annointing in rough  persons, indulgence in bath, constitution, old age, continued disorder and anger make  a person over-lean. The over-lean does not tolerate physical excercise, over-saturation,  hunger, thirst, disease and drugs and also too much cold, heat and sexual intercourse.  The over-lean often becomes a victim of spleen (enlargement), cough, wasting,  dyspnoea, gaseous tumour, piles, abdominal diseases and also the disorders of graham.  The over-lean is the person who has dried up buttocks, abdomen and neck; prominent  vascular network; only remnant of skin and bone and with thick nodes. ",

Vidanga, sunthi, yavaksara and ash powder of black iron mixed with honey  and also the powder of barley and amalaka is an excellent formulation for the same.  Similarly, Bilvadi pancamula (five big roots) mixed with honey and the use of silajatu  alongwith the juice of agnimantha is recommended. In diet, prasatika (an inferior  cereal), kangu, syamaka, yavaka, yava (barley), jurna, kodrava, green gram, kulattha,  makusthaâ€™  adhakl alongwith patola and amalakl fruits are to be used. After meals,  honey water and arista (a fermented preparation) alleviating medas, mamsa and kapha  should be taken as drink.

1570," In the summer season, because of roughness due to adana, aggravation of vayu and  shortness of nights, day-sleep is recommended. ",
1571,39-43,
1572," By day-sleep in seasons other than summer, kapha and pitta are vitiated, hence  day-sleep is not indicated in those seasons. The obese, those having regular fatty diet,  plenty of kapha, kaphaja disorders and suffering from latent poisons should never  sleep during day. HalTmaka (chlorosis), headache, cold sensation, heaviness in body parts, body-  ache, loss of appetite and digestion, plastering of heart, oedema, anorexia, nausea,  rhinitis, migraine, urticarial patches, pustules, boils, itching, drowsiness, cough, dis- orders of throat, derangement of memory and intelligence, obstruction of channels,  fever, incapability of sence organs, intensity in effect of poisons-these occur by in- dulgence in unwholesome day-sleep. Hence, the wise, after knowing the wholesome- ness and unwholesomeness of sleep, should sleep happily. ",

These very  factors may be taken as causes of insomnia, alongwith (over) work, time (old age),  disorder (vatika), constitution (vatika) and aggravation of vata itself. ",

1595,1,
1596, As propounded by Lord Atreya. ,
1597,2,
1598," Atreya, impelling his six best disciples led by Agnivesa who were engaged in  penance and study, said-He is the real physician who knows the timely application  of reducing, promoting, roughening, uncting, sweating and checking measures. After  Atreya concluded his talk, Agnivesa put the following queries-'Sir, what is the reduc- the definition of promoting, roughening, uncting, sweating and checking therapies  and the persons fit for them. You may also tell briefly about the symptoms of proper  application, non-application and over-application of reducing measures etc. ",
1599,8-Mar,
1600, Having heard the words of Agnivesa the teacher (Atreya) said-whatever  produces lightness in the body is known as langhana (reducing therapy). What- ever promotes the bulk of the body is known as Brmhana (promoting therapy). ,
1601,page_no: ,
1602,0,
1603," Ruksana (roughening) is that which produces roughness, coarseness and non-slimi-  ness. Snehana (unction) is that which produces unction, oozing, softness and mois- tening. Swedana (sweating) produces sweat and alleviates stiffness, heaviness and  cold. Stambhana (checking therapy) is that which checks the movement of mobile substances. The drug possessing light, hot, sharp, non-slimy, rough, minute, coarse, unstable  and hard properties has got mostly the reducing effect. The drug possessing heavy,  cold, soft, unctuous, solid, gross, slimy, dull, stable and smooth properties is mostly  promoting in effect. Rough, light, coarse, sharp, hot, stable, non-slimy and hard  drug is mostly roughening in effect. Liquid, minute, non-stable, unctuous, slimy,  heavy, cold, dull and soft drug is mostly uncting in effect. Hot, sharp, unstable,  unctuous, rough, minute, liquid and stable drug is mostly sweating in effect. Cold,  dull, soft, smooth, rough, minute, liquid, stable and light drug is mostly checking  in effect. ",
1604,17-Sep,
1605," Reducing therapy may be applied in various forms such as four types of evacu- ation, thirst, exposure to wind and the sun, digestive measures, fasting and physical  exercise. ",
1606,18,
1607," Those having big body and strength, abundant kapha, pitta, blood and excreta,  and association of (aggravated) vayu should be subjected to reducing therapy by means  of evacuation. Those, afflicted with the diseases of moderate severity and caused by  kapha and pitta like vomiting, diarrhoea, heart disease, cholera, alasaka, fever, con- stipation, heaviness, eructation, nausea, anorexia etc. should mostly be treated with  digestives in the beginning by the learned physician. These very diseases, when with  little severity, should be overcome with control of thirst and fasting. The diseases of  moderate and little severity in strong persons should be treated with physical exercise  and exposure to the sun and wind. The persons suffering from skin disorders, diabetes  and those using excess of unctuous, channel-blocking and promoting diet and also  patients of vatika disorders should be subjected to reducing therapy in sisira (late  winter).

1612," Undamaged meat of ault animals, fish and birds living in suitable environments  and killed with non-poisonous weapons is (the best) promoting one. The persons  wasted, wounded, lean, old, weak, constantly travelling on foot and indulged in women  and wine and also in the summer are suitable for promoting therapy. For those suffer- ing from consumption, piles, disorders of graham and wasted by other (similar) dis- eases, the light meat-soup of carnivorous animals is the best promoting one. Bath,  annointing, sleep, enema with sweet and unctuous substances, sugar, milk and ghee  are universal promoters. ",
1613,25-28,
1614," Roughening therapy consis to of the regular intake of pungent, bitter and  astringent articles, sexual acts and use of oil-cakes, buttermilk and honey etc. The  roughening therapy is indicated in the diseases which are caused by blocking of  channels"", strong dosas and are located in vital parts and in urustambha (stiffening of  thighs) etc. Unction, persons suitable for unction, sweating and persons suitable for  sweating have been explained earlier in detail in the concerned chapters. ",
1615,29-31,
1616," All the drugs and measures consisting of liquid, thin, stable, cooling and having  sweet, bitter and astringent tastes constitute the checking therapy. It is indicated in  pitta, burns with alkali and fire, vomiting, diarrhoea, excessive application of poisons  and sweating. ",
1617,32-33,
1618," The roughening therapy should be regarded as properly administered when  there is proper elimination of wind, urine and faeces, lightness in body, cleansing of  heart, eructation, throat and mouth, disappearance of drowsiness and exhaustion,  appearance of sweat, relish and both hunger and thirst together, and also the feeling  of well being.

1622,34-37,
1623, On proper administration of promoting therapy one gets strength and corpulence  and gives up the defects of the lean. On excessive application of promotive therapy  one suffers from obesity. The symptoms of proper and excessive administration of  roughening therapy are the same as those of the reducing therapy. ,
1624,38,
1625," The checking therapy is regarded as properly administered when the disorders  are overcome and strength is gained. On excessive application of the checking therapy  the patient is afflicted with blackishness, stiffness in body parts, uneasiness, lockjaw,  and obstruction in heart (function) and excretion of faeces. ",
1626,39-40,
1627, All these therapies should be known generally as not adequately administered  when the treated dosas are not pacified rather are aggravated. Thus the six therapeutic  measures useful in all disorders and which are tried in treatment of the curable disor- ders in accordance with dose and time are said. ,
1628,41-42,
1629," Due to various combinations of dosas, the therapies also get mixed up but even  then they do not go beyond the six (numbers) like dosas (vata etc.) not transgressing  the three (numbers). ",
1630,43,
1631," Now the (summing up) verses- The six therapeutic measures have been explained, according to queries, by  the Lord (Atreya) in this chapter on the reducing etc. by which the treatment pro- ceeds. ",

Ill) are rec- ommended. Triphala, aragvadha, patha, saptaparna, kutaja, musta, madana and nimba-  these should be decocted in water. By regular use of this decoction according to  dose and time diseases caused by oversaturation like diabetes etc. are alleviated cer- tainly. Musta, aragvadha, patha, triphala, devadaru, goksura, khadira, nimba, both types  of haridra (haridra and daruharidra), and bark of kutaja-by using the decoction of  these drugs in the morning according to dosa one is relieved of all the diseases caused  by over-saturation. These very drugs applied in the form of annointings, rubbings, baths and also  mixed with uncting substances alleviate the skin disorders. Kustha, gomedaka (onyx), hingu, bone of kraunca (a bird), trikatu, vaca, vasa,  ela, goksura, yavanT and pasanabheda-the powder of these drugs taken alongwith but- ter-milk, curd-water, or sour jujube juice alleviates dysuria and prameha. Prameha etc. get alleviated by the administration of buttermilk with harTtakT  triphala and arista (a fermented preparation). Trikatu, triphala, honey, vidanga, ajamoda  are mixed with roasted grain flour and mantha (churned drink like lassi) is prepared  adding some oil and decoction of aguru.

All this is mixed  up with sixteen times of roasted grain flour and a saturating drink (mantha) is pre- pared. By the use of this preparation the diseases caused by over-saturation like  prameha, disorders of flatus, leprosy, piles, jaundice, spleen (enlargement), anaemia,  swelling, dysuria, anorexia, heart disease, phthisis, cough, dyspnoea, choking of  throat, helminthiasis, disorders of graham, leucoderma, over obesity are alleviated,  the digestive power is stimulated and memory and intellect develop.

1647,25-Aug,
1648," Further, the diseases caused by under- nutrition will be described alongwith their  treatment. Loss of body (weight), digestive power, strength, lustre, ojas, semen and  musculature; fever, continuous cough, pain in sides (chest), anorexia, weakness in  nearing, insanity, delirium, cardiac pain, obstruction in excretion of urine and stool,  pain in shanks, thighs and sacral region, tearing pain in nodes and joints, and other  vatika disorders like upward movement of vayu etc. are caused by under-nutrition.  They are treated by experts with saturating measures which exhibit their effects in- stantly or after prolonged use. ",
1649,26-30,
1650," One afflicted with acute wasting regains nomalcy by administration of immedi- ately acting saturating measures while the other suffering from chronic wasting does  not recover except by prolonged use of such measures. In case of chronic debility, the  physician should administer the treatment unhurriedly keeping in view the body, power  of digestion, dosa, drugs, dose and time. For such patients, meat-soup, plenty of  milk, ghee, bath, enema, massage and saturating drinks are beneficial. The saturating  drinks beneficial for those suffering from fever, cough, emaciation, dysuria, thirst  and upward vayu will now be described. Mantha (churned drink) prepared with equal quantity of sugar, long pepper, oil,  ghee and honey alongwith double the quantity of roasted grain flour is aphrodisiac  and recommended for them. ",

1653," Roasted grain flour mixed with wine, honey and sugar makes a saturating drink  which is carminative for wind, stool, urine, kapha and pitta. The saturating drink prepared with phanita (a sugarcane product), roasted grain  flour, ghee, curd water and vinegar should be taken. This alleviates dysuria and up- ward movement of vayu. Mantha (saturating drink) with dates, grapes, vrksamla, tamarind, pomegranate,  parusaka and amalakl fruits alleviates alcoholic disorders. ",

In weak persons, when very strong dosas get located in the abode of vital breath  (heart) and affect the movement of speech, body and mind, coma ensues. The person  affected with coma looks stick-like and as dead and immediately succumbs to death  if the emergency is not managed quickly. As a wise person brings out the utensil  drowning in deep water quickly before it settles down (in bottom) (the physician  should manage), the patient suffering from coma. For arousing him (from the deep slumber), collyriums, drops, smokes, blowing,  needling, burning, pain in nail bed, plucking the hairs of head and body, biting with  teeth, rubbing with hairy fruits of atmagupta are useful. Besides, various types of  strong alcoholic liquors added with plenty of pungent substances should be poured  into his mouth frequently. Similarly, the juice of matulunga added with dry ginger  and sauvarcala (salt) combined with hingu alongwith wine, sour juice or vinegar should  be administered for arousing consciousness. When the patient regains consiousness he should be give light diet and during  this period he should be entertained with surprising narratives, memoirs, pleasing  talks, enchanting songs and playing of musical instruments and colourful scenery.

Hence (in my view),  the parents are the cause (in origin of person and the diseases). ",

Even in case  of the combination of rasas, there is no innumerableness of its primordial source,  natural properties and actions that is why the intelligent ones do not describe the  action of the combined rasas.

Thus the six forms of manifestation of rasas take place according to shortage and  excess of mahabhutas like various complexions and shapes in plants and animals. The  shortage and excess of mahabhutas is possible due to kala (the time factor) having six  seasons. ",
1874,40,
1875," Amongst them, the rasas having agni and vayu often move upwards because of  lightness, rushing up of vayu and flaming up of agni. Those predominant in ap and  prthivT often move downwards due to heaviness of prthivT and downward moving ten- dency of ap (water). Those having mixed constitutions move both ways. ",

(5) Kasaya rasa is pacifying, astringent, union-promoting, compressing, healing,  absorbing, checking (discharges); pacifies kapha, rakta and pitta; utilises the  body fluid, is rough, cold and slightly light. This, though possessing so many  qualities, if used singly and excessively, dries up mouth, causes heart-ache, flatu- lence, hindrance in voice, slowing of movement in channels, blackishness, impotency,  gas formation during digestion; checks flatus, urine, faeces and semen; produces  emaciation, malaise, thirst, stiffness; and, because of its coarseness, non-sliminess  and roughness, causes vatika disorders like hemiplegia, spasm, convulsions, facial  paralysis etc. ",

Some substance of amla  rasa is astringent while other is purgative such as kapittha comes in the former while  amalaka in the latter group. Katu rasa is non-aphrodisiac but pippall and sunthl (though  katurasa) are aphrodisiac. Kasaya rasa is checking and cold but haritakT (though kasaya)  is laxative and hot.

From the point of view of  unctuousness, madhura is in the highest degree, amla in the middle and lavana in  the lowest one. Considering coldness, madhura, kasaya and tikta come in order of  superiority. Considering heaviness, madhura comes in the highest degree, kasaya in  the middle and lavana in the lowest degree. Considering lightness, tikta comes on the  top, then katu and lastly amla. Some take lavana as the inferior one in the category  light rasas.

Various effects of gems wearable (on  the body) is also due to prabhava, their prabhava is unthinkable. Thus vipaka, vlrya  and prabhava are explained well. Some drugs acts by (means of rasa), other by vlrya  and other by guna, vipaka or prabhava. In case of equality of strength, vipaka subdues  rasa, vlrya subdues both, and prabhava all these three.

While in mouth, it per- vades and as if makes a coating there. If, after putting in mouth, there is sensitisation  of teeth, salivation, sweating, awakening of mouth (gustatory sensations) and burning  in mouth and throat, that should be labelled as amla rasa. Lavana rasa is dissolved  quickly and produces moistening, watering, softening and burning in mouth. That  which, on contact, irritates and produces piercing pain in tounge and stimulates secre- tions with burning from mouth, nose and eyf s is pungent. That which, on contact with  tongue, destroys all other gustatory perceptions so that no other taste is perceived;  and also gives rise to non-sliminess and dryness in mouth, alongwith cheerfulness, is  tikta (rasa). Kasaya is that which produces non-sliminess, stiffness and coldness in  tongue, as if choking the throat and is also depressent. ",

One should not take any fish alongwith milk particularly  cilacima because it, being great obstructor of channels, produces these disorders with  gross symptoms and also excites amavisa. Meat of domestic, marshy and aquatic ani- mals should not be taken mixed with honey, sesamum, jaggery, milk, black gram,  radish, lotus stalk or germinated grains because it causes deafness, blindness,  tremors, coldness, indistinct voice, nasal voice or death. The potherb of puskara or  rohinl or (meat of) pigeon fried with mustard oil should not be taken alongwith honey  and milk because it causes obstruction in blood-circulation, athero-sclerosis, epilepsy,  sankhaka, goitre, rohinl or death. After eating radish, garlic, sigru, arjaka, tulasl  etc. one should not take milk because of the risk of leprosy. The potherb of jatuka  or ripe (fruit of) nikuca should not be taken alongwith honey and milk as it causes  death, or loss of strength, lustre, energy and prowess; severe diseases and impotency.  The same ripe (fruit of) nikuca should not be taken with black gram, pulse, jaggery  and ghee because they are antagonistic. Likewise, amra, amrataka, matulunga, nikuca,  karamarda, moca, dantaSatha, badara, kosamra, bhavya, jambu, narikela, dadima,  amalaka-these fruits and similar other substances, all sour liquids or non-liquids  are antagonistic to milk. Kangu, vanaka, makusthaka, kulattha, black gram and  nispava are antagonistic to milk. The potherb of padmottarika (kusumbha), sarkara  and maireya (types of wine) and madhu, all used together are antagonistic and  vitiate vata too much. Haridraka (a bird) fried with mustard oil is antagnostic  and vitiates pitta too much. Payasa (rice cooked with milk) taken with after drink  of mantha (a drink prepared from roasted grain flour) is antagnostic and vitiates  kapha too much.

If in arid zone rough and sharp substances, and in  marshy region unctuous and cold ones are used, it is known as antagonistic in respect  of place. Likewise, if one takes rough and cold etc. in the winter and pungent, hot etc.  in the summer, it is antagonistic in terms of time. Similar is the antagonism of food  and drinks in four types of agni. Honey and ghee taken together in equal quantity is  antagonistic in dose. The use of sweet, cold etc. by a person accustomed to pungent,  hot etc. is antagonism in suitability. Use of diet, drug and behaviour similar to dosas  in properties but adverse to the person's practice is antagonistic to dosas. When the  edible becomes poisonous by particular processing such as in case of peacock's meat  attached to the castor stick, it is known as antagonism in processing. Antagonism in  potency is that when sltavTrya and usnavlrya substances combined together are taken.  Antagonism in bowels is that when too little, of mild potency and non-breaking drug  is administered in (persons having) hard bowels; while heavy, breaking and abundant  one is administered in (those) having soft bowel. When vata-vitiating substance  is given to the person indulged in overwork, sexual intercourse and exercise and kapha-  vitiating one in that indulged in oversleep and laziness it is antagonism in respect  of health condition. Antagonism in order is that where one takes food before excret- ing faeces and urine and without appetite or excessive hunger. If hot things are  taken after intake of pork etc. or cold ones after intake of ghee etc. it is known as  antagonism in indication and contra-indication. Antagonism in cooking consists  of cooking on damaged or bad fuel or if the grains are uncooked, over-cooked or  burnt. Sour things taken with milk is antagonism in combination. Antagonism in pal- atability is taking of unliked things. Antagonism in richness (of qualities) is that if  there is immature, overmature or damaged rasa in a substance. It is antagonism in  rules if the food is not taken in privacy. Food taken in the above way is known as  antagonistic. ",

Merits and demerits of water contained in oblong ponds, well tank, spring, lake  and streams may be decided on the basis whether they are situated in marshy, hilly  or arid regions. Silmy, having insects, purified, full of leaves, moss and mud, having abnormal  colour and taste, viscous and foul-smelling water is not wholesome. The saline water of sea has fishy smell and aggravates dosas. Thus the eight groups of water are described with certainty. ",

The excretion nourishes sweat,  urine, faeces, vata, pitta and kapha, dirt of ears, eyes, nostrils, mouth, hair follicles  and genitals, and the parts like hair, beard, moustaches, nails etc. From 'ahara-  rasa' (essence of food) are nourished rasa, rakta (blood), mamsa (muscle), medas  (fat), asthi (bones), majja (marrow), Sukra (semen) and ojas, the basic materials  of five sense organs which are known as 'dhatu prasada' (clear essence of dhatus),  and parts like ligaments, lubricating substance in joints etc. All these dhatus  (supporting materials) in the forms of essence and excretion maintain their nor- mal measure according to age and body receiving proper nutrients from rasa and  mala respectively.

These etiological  factors afflict the person in spite of his taking proper food. That is why the persons  taking wholesome food are also seen as diseased. In case of those taking unwhole- some food too, the fault dose not produce derangements immediately due to certain  reasons such as unwholesome articles are not equally deranging nor have the dosas  equal strength, all persons also are not (equally) capable to resist the disease (have no  equal immunity). The same faulty regimen becomes mere obnoxious due to place,  time, combination, potency and excessive quantity. The same dosa too, in combina- tion with other dosa, having contradictory therapy, deep-seated, with long duration,  located in the organs of vital breath, affecting the vital parts becomes curable  with difficulty and even fatal emergently. The persons too obese, too lean, having  uncompact muscles, blood and bones, weak, indulged in unsuitable food, under-nour- ished and having weak mind are not able to resist diseases, contrary to them are  resistant to diseases. Because of variations in faulty diet, innate pathogenic factors  and the condition of the body the diseases become mild or severe, acute or chronic.

The remedy of disorders produced in rasa consists of all types of reducing meas- ures. The treatment of the blood disorders has already been said in the chapter on  properly formed blood. The disorders of marhsa are treated with evacuative measures,  surgical measures and application of alkali and cauterization. The treatment of the  disorders of medas is described in the chapter on the eight despicable ones. The reme- dial measure in the disorders of asthi consists of the five evacuative measures, enema  and intake of bitter-medicated milk and ghee. The therapy of diseases caused in majja  and sukra consists of the intake of predominantly sweet and bitter food, sexual inter- course, physical exercise and elimination of dosas in time and in proper quantity. The  treatment of disorders of sense organs will be mentioned in the chapter on three vital  organs.

There was never non-existence of the flow of life  or intellect. The knower of Ayurveda is also eternally continuing. Pleasure (health)  and pain (disease) alongwith material factors, causes and symptoms, because of  their inter-relations, are also eternal. All these point towards the eternal continuity  of Ayurveda. (Secondly), substances having properties of heavy, light, cold, hot,  unctuous, rough etc. are subjected to increase or decrease by the law of similarity  and dissimilarity. As is said, in case of regular intake of heavy substances, the  heavy will increase and the light will decrease. Thus in case of other substances  as well. This character of entities is eternal. (Thirdly), the characters of the subs- tances like earth etc. are also eternal. The substances alongwith their properties  are eternal. Ayurveda never arose out of non-existence except understanding and  precepts; some say its origin in view of these two. Its natural characters are  non-artificial as said here and in the first chapter such as hotness of fire and liquidity  of water.

2427," SUTRASTHANA 245 In Cikitsitasthana (section on therapeutics), there are thirty chapters. Out of these  first two chapters relate to rasayana (promotive measures) and vajlkarana (aphrodisi- acs) respectively and have four quarters each. The chapter on Rasayana consists of a  quadruplet of haritaki-amalaki, desire for vital breath, amalakl plucked with hand and  traditional importance of rasayan. The chapter on vajlkarana consists of the following  quadruplets-root of sara, (rice) soaked in milk, (cow) fed on leaves of black gram and  the person having gained strength. The other twenty eight chapters relate to fever,  internal haemorrhage, gulma, prameha, kustha phthisis, insanity, epilepsy, (chest)  wound, swelling, abdominal diseases, piles, graham roga, anaemia, dyspnoea, cough,  diarrhoea, vomiting, erysipelas, thirst, poison, alcoholism, wounds, diseases of three  vital organs, urustambha (stiffness of thighs), vatavyadhi, vatarakta, yonivyapat (dis- orders of female genital organs).

2438," Interrogation is the question on any subject from the treatise according to the  accepted procedure. Interpretation of the interrogation is the rational solution of the  same on the basis of the treatise. The word 'Tantra' is derived from 'tantrana' (pervasi- veness and protection), 'Sthana' from 'arthapratistha' (containing the subject well)  and the titles of the adhyayas (chapters) are based on various topics. Thus according  to query, the entire 'Astaka' (eight topics) has been explained. In this way, the well-  defined subject-matter of the text has also been said in entirety. ",
2439,69-71,
2440," There are persons having partial and superficial informations whose unexpected  flying up creates irritation like that of male bustard. Hence, in the beginning of the  talk, one should always put the eight topics with a view to testing the superiority or  inferiority because there only the well-versed in scriptures can stand while those  knowing a portion of it feel giddy by the very word of the entire treatise like the  week bustards by the sound of bow-string.

One, dispassionately, should not  tolerate the little-knowing but talkative and quarrel-some persons in order to bring to  light the importance of real knowledge. Those who are compassionate to creatures  and are sincerely devoted to real knowledge pay attention to checking the ignoble  debates. ",

2464, As propounded by Lord Atreya. ,
2465,2,
2466," Here hetu, nimitta, ayatana, kartta, karana, pratyaya and samutthana-these are  synonyms of nidan. It is of three types-unsuitable conjunction of sense organs with  their objects, intellectual error and consequence. ",
2467,3,
2468," From these, three trpes of (som atic) diseases arise-agneya (paittika),  saumya (kaphaja) and (vatika). The others (psychic) are of two types-rajasa and  tamasa. ",
2469,4,
2470," Here vyadhi, amaya, gada, atanka, yaksma, jwara and vikara-these are synonyms  of roga. ",
2471,5,
2472," Knowledge of disease (is acquired) through nidana (etiology), purvarupa  (prodroma), liiiga (signs and symptoms), upasaya (therapeutic suitability) and  samprapti (pathogenesis). ",
2473,6,
2474," Nidana is the etiological factor, as already said. ",
2475,7,
2476,  Purvarupa consists of the (unmanifested) symptoms which precede the appear- ance of the disease. ,
2477,8,
2478, ,

2482,9,
2483," Upasaya is the suitable use of drug, diet and behaviour which are contrary to the  etiology and (or) disease or which produce effects contrary to them. ",
2484,10,
2485," Samprapti, jati and agati (of disease) are synonyms. ",
2486,11,
2487," That (samprapti) is further subdivided according to sankhya (number), padhanya  (predominance), vidhi (types), vikalpa (proportional variation) and balakala (aggra- vation time). (1) Number-such as eight fevers, five gulmas, seven leprosies etc (2) Predominance of dosas is known by their relative degrees, Comparative degree is  indicated by (the suffix) â€™ tara' and the superlative one by 'tama'. (3) Type such as two types of diseases-innate and exogenous; three types according  to tridosa; four types (according to prognosis) such as curable, incurable, mild and  severe. (4) Proportional variation in the strength of conjoined dosas in vikalpa in the present  context. (5) The time of aggravation of diseases is ascertained on the basis of season, day and  night, time and method of intake of food. ",
2488,12,

2496," First of all, (I) will describe, in the order beginning with etiology, the earliest  eight diseases arisen from greed, malice and anger, alongwith are principles of  therapeutics in brief. Later on in the section on therapeutics (I) will describe the later  developed disorders. ",
2497,15,
2498," Amongst the diseases, fever is described first because of its being the earliest  (in appearance) of the somatic diseases. ",
2499,16,

Thus they produce fever accordingly. ",
2532,28,
2533," By observing the said symptoms of fever (caused by single dosas) getting mixed  up, one should know one of the dual fevers or the sannipatika one. ",
2534,29,
2535," The exogenous one is the eighth type of fever initiated with pain and caused by  injury, evil organisms, spell and curse. It remains as such for a while and later on gets  associated with dosas. Amongst them, that caused by injury (is associated) with vayu  located in affected blood; that caused by evil organisms with vata and pitta and those  by spell and curse with sannipata. ",
2536,30,
2537," It should be taken as one distinguished from other seven types of fever  because of having specific symptoms, treatment and etiology. It is, however  treated with general therapeutic measures. Thus eightfold genesis of fever is  said. ",

2541,0,
2542," Fever is only one having pyrexia as specific symptom. The same is said as of  two types according to liking (liking for cold and that for heat) and also to character  of innate and exogenous. The innate fever is again of two types (caused by combined  or uncombined dosas), three types (caused by three single dosas, four types (caused  by three single dosas and sannipata), and seven types (caused by three single dosas,  three duals and one sannipata) due to proportional variations of (dosas) vata etc. ",

2545,33,
2546, Thus are described the symptoms of fever individually in detail and brief. ,
2547,34,
2548," Fever is originated by the anger of Maheswara, it takes away the life of  all living beings, causes disturbance in body, sense organs and mind, dimin- ishes intellect, strength, complexion, pleasure and enthusiasm.

2551," is so severe, complicated and difficult in management as this. It is the king of all  diseases and is known by different terms in various animals. All living beings are  born with fever and die with it, it is the great bewilderment, oppressed by it the  living beings do not recollect any event of their previous birth, fever itself takes  away the life of the living beings in the end. ",
2552,35,
2553," I  I On appearance of prodromal symptoms or in the beginning of fever light food or  saturation is advised because fever origintes from amasaya. Afterwards intake of ex- tracts, massage, unction, fomentation, pasting, sprinkling, afterpaste, emesis, purga- tion, non-unctuous and unctuous enema, pacificatory measures, snuffing, fumigation,  smoking, collyrium, milk and dietitic regimen are administered properly according to  condition. ",
2554,36,
2555," However, in all types of jTrna jwara (chronic fever) intake of ghee cooked with  proper drugs is recommended because ghee pacifies vata due to unctuousness, kapha  due to processing, pitta and heat due to coldness, hence in all chronic fevers ghee is  wholesome like water on substances scorched by fire. ",
2556,37,
2557," Here are (the verses)- As they sprinkle water on a burning house to subdue (the fire), ghee is adminis- tered in chronic fever. Ghee pacifies vata due to unctuousness, pitta due to cold and  even kapha which is similar in properties due to processing (with drugs), No other fat  receives the (properties of) Samskara (processing with drugs) as ghee and that is why  it is regarded as the best of all the fats.

2565,42-44,
2566, Thus ends the first chapter on diagnosis of fever in Nidanasthana in the  treatise composed by Agnivesa and redacted by Caraka. (1) Now (I) shall expound the chapter on diagnosis of innate haemorrhage. ,
2567,1,
2568, As propounded by Lord Atreya. ,

With blood exceeding its  (normal) measure the vitiated pitta, while circulating in the body, reaches the open- ings of blood-carrying channels originating from liver and spleen, obstructs them which  are already heavy due to congestion of blood and thus affects the blood morbidly.

2576,4,
2577,"I Pitta is called lohitapitta because it contacts with blood, affects it and acquires  its smell and colour. ",
2578,5,
2579,"  It gives rise to these prodromal symptoms-such as aversion to food, mal-diges-  tion of food, eructation having smell and taste of sour gruel, frequent urge for vomit- ing, disgusting vomit, hoarseness of voice, malaise, spreading burning sensation, as  if emittance of smoke from mouth, smell of metal, blood, fish and mucus in the mouth,  appearance of red, green or yellow colour in body parts, faeces, urine, sweat, salive,  nose-secretion, excreta from mouth and ear, and boils; body-ache frequent vision of  red, blue, yellow, blackish and brilliant objects in dreams (these are the prodromal  symptoms of lohitapitta (internal haemorrhage).

2586," It has got two paths-upwards and downwards. In persons having abundance of  kapha, going upward in contact with kapha, it bleeds through ear, nose, eyes and  mouth; in those having abundant vata, going downwards in contact with vata, it bleeds  through the passages of urine and faeces and in those having abundance of both kapha  and vata, in contact of both of them, it follows both the paths and thus bleeds through  all the aforesaid orifices. ",
2587,8,
2588," Amongst these, that coming out upwards is curable because of being treatable by  purgation and plenty of applicable drugs. That coming out downwards is palliable  because of being amenable to emesis and less number of applicable drugs. That com- ing out from both the paths is incurable because of non-applicability of both emesis  and purgation and want of proper drugs. ",

2595, Here are (the verses)- Raktapitta which comes out upwards is curable because of applicability of pur- gation and abundance of useful drugs. Purgation is the best remedy for alleviation  of pitta and also not ineffective for kapha which is associated with it. Sweet drugs  are also applicable there. Hence haeemorrhage coming out from the upper part is  curable. ,
2596,14-Dec,
2597," Haemorrhage from the lower parts is decidedly palliable because emesis is slightly  applicable here and useful drugs are also a few. Emesis is not so efficacious for elimi- nation of pitta and it is also ineffective in alleviation of vata which is associated with  pitta. Moreover, astringent an.d bitter drugs are not applicable there. Hence haemor- rhage from the lower parts is regarded as palliable. ",
2598,15-17,
2599," Raktapitta which comes out from both the parts should be known as incurable  from the aforesaid reasons. Here no evacuative measure is applicable which goes out  from the path opposite to that of haemorrhage. In raktapitta, elimination of dosas  from the opposite path is recommended. Likewise, there is no alround pacificatory  measure for this while in combined dosas the pacificatory measure should be able to  pacify all the dosas. Thus three types of rakta (pitta) have been described according to  different paths. ",
2600,18-20,
2601," Some curable disease is not treated successfully because of the lack of attendants  and equipments, uncontrolled self and fault of the physician. Omission of the proper  remedy also makes some disease incurable. Incurability is one which comes gradually  through curability and payability. ",

It causes pain and nodules of various types,  remains massified, because of massification, it is called gulma (that which forms a  bolus). It sometimes aggravates, sometimes is diminished, having unstable severe  and mild pain due to instability of vayu, sometimes there is a sensation of ants'  crawlings in organs, frequency of various types of pain such as piercing, breaking,  twitching, extension, contraction, numbness, oversensitivity, the patient feels himself  as having been pierced with needle or nail, rise of temperature in evening, dryness  of mouth, respiratory trouble, horripilation at the onset of pain; occurence of  complications such as spleen (enlargement), distension and gurgling sound in  abdomen, indigestion, udavarta (upward movement of vayu), body-ache, pain in  sternomastoid, head and temples and Bradhna (swelling of inguinal glands),  appearance of blackness, reddishness and roughness in skin, nails, eyes, face, urine  and faeces, unsuitability of the etiological factors and suitability of the contrary ones.

Whatever is non-contrary may  also be administered according to the severity or mildness of complications. The  severe complications should be treated quickly and others later on. When a physician  in hurry is unable to distinguish the types of gulma and in emergent conditions he  should administer the therapeutic measures as prescribed for vata such as proper  application of vata-alleviating unction and fomentation, unctuous mild purgation and  enema and amla, lavana and madhura rasas.

2665,1,
2666, As propounded by Lord Atreya. ,
2667,2,
2668, Vitiation of three dosas is the cause of twenty types of prameha and also of  other innumerable disorders. How the vitiation of three dosas leads to the genesis of  premehas is explained below. ,
2669,3,
2670," According to the particular features of etiology, dosas (innate pathogenic fac- tors) and dusyas (substratum of pathos) response occurs in the form of nonmanifesta- tion or otherwise of the disorders. When these (above) three factors (nidana etc.) do  not combine together or if combined after a long time or in weakened state, disorder  will not be there, or it will manifest lately, or in a mild form or without all the said  symptoms. On the contrary, the result will be contrary. Thus is said the cause of re- sponse in the form of non-manifestation or otherwise of all disorders. ",
2671,4,
2672,"These three factors nidana etc. cause immediate manifestation of pramehas  due to kapha-Such as in excessive quantity and prolonged use of new grains like  hayanaka, yavaka, cinaka, uddalaka, naisadha, itkata, mukundaka, mahavrlhi,  pramodaka and sugandhaka; use of new legumes like harenu and black gram, meat  of domesticated, marshy and aquatic animals, vegetables, sesamum paste, prepara- tions of (rice) flour, payasa (rice cooked with milk), krSara (preparation of rice ",

All this constitutes  particular etiology (of kaphaja prameha). ",
2676,5,
2677, The particular dosa is kapha consisting of abundant fluid. ,
2678,6,
2679,"  Abundant and non-compact medas and muscle; body fluid, semen, blood,  muscle-fat, marrow, laslka, rasa and ojas-these are the particular dusyas (in  prameha). ",
2680,7,
2681," By combination of all these three factors (nidana etc.) kapha gets vitiated imme- diately because of the predominance of its aggravating factors. When vitiated, it spreads  all over the body immediately due to laxity of body. While spreading at first it gets  mixed up with the fat because fat is abundant, non-compact and similar in properties.  While mixing up kapha affects it morbidly due to its vitiation. Now that vitiated kapha  associated with fat joins with body fluid and muscle because the latter are increased  excessively. Thus affecting the muscle, it produces boils Saravika, kacchapika etc.  due to sloughing of muscle because of abnormalcy. By affecting the body fluid, trans- forms it in urine and also blocks the heavy openings of the urinary tubules coming  out from vahksana (urinary bladder) and basti (kidney) and associated with fat and  fluid. Thus it (kapha) produces the (kaphaja) pramehas and leads to their stability or  incurability, due to abnormalcy. ",

2686," The body fluid mixed with kapha and fat while entering into the urinary bladder  is transformed into urine and is associated with ten properties of kapha in abnormal  state such as white, cold, formed, slimy, transparent, unctuous, heavy, sweet, vis- cous, clear and slow. Then it acquires the similar secondary name according to its  association with one or more of these properties. ",
2687,19,
2688," Thus there are ten types of prameha with particular names-such as-udakameha,  iksuvalikarasameha, sandrameha, sandraprasadameha, suklameha, Sukrameha,  sTtameha, sikatameha, sanairmeha and alalameha. ",
2689,10,
2690," These ten types of prameha are curable because they are located in fat having  similar properties, kapha is predominant and similarity in treatment. ",
2691,11,
2692," By vitiation of kapha the patient of udakameha excretes urine as transparent,  abundant, white, cold, odourless and water-like. By vitiation of kapha one excretes urine as excessively sweet, cold, slightly slimy,  turbid and like the juice of iksuvalika. One whose urine when kept for the night precipitates in the pot is known as pa- tient of sandrameha due to vitiation of kapha. One whose urine partly precipitates and is partly clear is known as a patient of  sandraprasadameha due to vitiation of kapha. ",

One who passes urine frequenlty like semen or mixed with semen is said a pa- tient of sukrameha due to vitiation of kapha. One who passes urine frequently as excessively sweet and cold is known as a  patient of STtameha due to vitiation of kapha. One who passes small particles situated morbidly in urine is known as a patient  of sikatameha due to vitiation of kapha. One who passes urine with difficulty and slowly without any urge is known as  suffering from sanairmeha due to vitiation of kapha. One who excretes urine as bound with threads, saliva-like and slimy should be  known as a patient of alalameha due to vitiation of kapha. Thus the above ten types of prameha due to vitiation of kapha have been de- scribed. ",

2697," Hiving, vilfedAgg, In a person who uses hot, sour, saline, alkaline and pungent food and food during  indigestion, is exposed to very intese heat of the sun and fire, exertion, anger and  irregular diet, and having similar body, pitta gets vitiated immediately and by the  same mechanism gives rise instantaneously to these six types of prameha. Their spe- cific names are based on the specific properties of pitta such as-ksarameha, kalameha,  nTlameha, lohitameha, manjisthameha and haridrameha. They are associated with the  six properties of pitta such as alkalinity, sourness, salinity, pungency, fleshy smell  and hotness. ",

2702," All these are palliable because of their causation by combined dosas, location in  medas and contradictory treatment. The person suffering from ksarameha due to vitiation of pitta passes urine like  alkali in respect of smell, colour, taste and touch. One should be diagnosed as a case of kalameha due to vitiation of pitta if he  passes constantly urine as hot and of black colour. One should be known as suffering from nllameha due to vitiation of pitta if he  passes urine as sour and having colour like that of the feather of the casa (bird). One should be known as a patient of raktameha due to vitiation of pitta if he  passes urine as having fleshy smell, saline, hot and red. One should be diagnosed as a case of manjisthameha due to vitiation of pitta if  he excretes urine frequently like the decoction of manjistha (a red herb root) and  having fleshy smell. One should be known as a patient of haridrameha due to vitiation of pitta if he  passes urine like decoction of haridra (yellow) and as pungent. Thus the above six types of prameha due to vitiation of pitta have been des- cribed. ",
2703,27-35,
2704," In the person who uses astringent, pungent, bitter, rough, light, cold, sexual  intercourse, physical exercise; emesis, purgation, non-unctuous enema and head  evacuation in excess; suppresion of natural urges, fasting, injury, the sun, excite- ment, anxiety, excessive blood-letting vigils and uneven body postures; and  having similar body, vata gets vitiated immediately. When this vitiated vata while  spreading in the similar body takes vasa (muscle fat) along and enters into the  urinary channels it gives rise to vasameha. When it extracts majja to mutrabasti it  gives rise to majjameha, when it carries lasTka (lymph) to mutraSaya (urinary bladder)  40 C.S.-I ",

Ojas is of sweet nature but when due to roughness of vayu it gets  associated with astringency and is carried to urinary bladder, it gives rise to  madhumeha (diabetes). ",
2708,36-37,
2709,"Physicians say these four types of prameha caused by vata as incurable because  of great severity and contradictory treatment. Their specific names are also, as said above, according to specific properties  such as-vasameha, majjameha, hastimeha and madhumeha. Here are the verses for the detailed knowledge of the (types of) vatika prameha. One who passes urine frequenlty mixed with vasa (muscle fat) or similar to it is  said to be suffering from vasameha due to vitiation of vata. It is incurable. One who passes majja (marrow) alongwith urine frequently is known as a patient  of majjameha due to vitiation of vata. It is incurable. One who passes urine excessively and constantly like an excited elephant is known  as a patient of hastimeha due to vitiation of vata. It is incurable. One who passes urine as astringent-sweet, pale and rough should be diagnosed as  a case of madhumeha (diabetes) due to vitiation of vata which is incurable. Thus these four types of prameha due to vitiation of vata are described. Thus twenty types of prameha caused by vitiation of three dosas are (also) de- scribed. ",

Death, in the form of prameha, takes away immediately the person who is dull in  activities, over-obese, over-uncted and voracious eater.

That which goes to  amaSaya produces diseases of lungs and anorexia; that which goes to throat produces  irritation of throat and hoarseness of voice; that which goes into the channels carrying  vital breath causes dyspnoea and coryza; that which is located in head produces dis- tress in head, thus due to wound in lungs, irregular movement of vayu and irritation of  throat cough arises frequently and because of this, lungs having been wounded fur- ther haemoptysis starts, and consequently the patient becomes weak. Thus these com- plications due to over-exertion afflict the person indulged in it. Further because of  having been afflicted with these wasting complications, he gradually falls a prey to  phthisis. Hence the wise should take up works considering and commensurate to his  strength because the body is dependent on strength and the person basically consists  of the body. ",
2772,4,
2773, Here is the verse- One should abstain from over-exertive action in order to protect his life because  he will be able to enjoy the desired fruits of the action only if he lives. ,
2774,5,
2775,"  That suppression of natural urges is a cause of phthisis will be explained fur- ther. When a person checks the impelled urges of flatus, urine and faeces because  of attending the king, the master or the preceptors or having joined the society  of gambling and nobles in the midst of women; or while travelling on uneven  vehicle; due to fear, environment, bashfulness or disgust, vayu gets vitiated due to ",

2778," suppression of urges. This vitiated vayu aggravating pitta and kapha spreads upwards,  downwards and obliquely. Then, as said earlier, with a portion entering into the spe- cific body parts gives rise to pain, diarrhoea or drying up of faeces, excessive pain in  sides (of chest), pain in shoulder, irritation in throat and lungs, headache, cough,  dyspnoea, fever, hoarseness of voice and coryza; then having been afflicted with these  wasting complications, the patient gradually becomes a victim of phthisis. Hence the  wise should be paticularly careful in observing the ways which promote and protect  the body; body is their substratum and also the base of the person. ",
2779,6,
2780," Here is the verse- Setting all over things aside, one should protect one's body because in its ab- sence there becomes complete absence of all the bodily entities. ",
2781,7,
2782,"  That wasting is the cause of phthisis will be explained further. When a person is  invaded excessively at heart by anxiety and grief; or by envy, ambitions, fear, anger  etc.; or while being emaciated uses rough food and drinks; or weak by birth is subjected  to fasting or malnutrition, his rasa residing in heart gets diminished and because of  this he acquires phthisis. In case of want of (proper) management, he gets associated  with the disease having symptoms to be described later. (1) ",

2785," Or when a person due to excessive passion and with excessive attachment to  woman indulges in excessive sexual intercourse, his semen gets diminished because  of this. Inspite of semen being diminished, if his mind is not detracted from women,  and he is further engaged in sexual act with excessively determined passion, his se- men is not discharged because of its already diminished state so due to physical  exertion (during coitus) vayu enters into the blood vessels and causes blood discharged  from them which comes out of the seminal passage, due to loss of semen, alongwith  the symptoms of vata. Now, due to loss of semen and haemorrhage, his joints become  loose, roughness appears, body becomes further weak and vayu gets vitiated. The  vitiated vayu spreading in the body devoid of semen and blood and aggravating kapha  and pitta dries up muscles and blood, expels kapha and pitta, causes pain in sides (of  chest) and shoulders, irritation in throat, aggravating the kapha of head, refills it with  kapha, causing pain in joints produces body-ache, anorexia and indigestion, due to  stirring up of pitta and kapha and taking opposite course vayu gives rise to fever,  cough dyspnoea hoarseness of vbice and coryza. Due to frequent cough the lungs  are injured and haemoptysis ensues, consequently the patient suffers from debility  and having been afflicted with these wasting complications he gradually becomes a  victim of phthsis. Hence the wise protecting his body should protect his semen because  it is the final product of food. Here is the verse- Semen is the best essence of one's food hence it should be protected because its  diminution leads to many diseases or even death. ",

2790,"The irregular dieting is a cause of phthisis will be explained further. When a  person takes usually the food-drinkable, eatable, chewable and lickable-irregularly  in terms of nature, preparation, combination, quantity, place, time, rules for dietitic  use and suitability, his vata, pitta and kapha attain imbalance. These imbalanced dosas  spreading in the body when stay obstructing the openings of channels whatever food  he takes is mostly transformed into urine and faeces only and not so into other dhatus.  In this stage he continues on the support of faeces, hence faeces should be protected  particularly in case of the person suffering from phthisis and also of that who is too  much lean and weak. In him devoid of nourishment, dosas aggravated due to irregular  dieting produce respective complications and lead to further degradation. Vata causes  pain, body-ache, irritation of throat, chest pain, pain in shoulders, hoarseness of voice  and coryza, pitta causes fever, diarrhoea, internal heat and kapha produces coryza,  heaviness of head, anorexia and cough. Due to frequent cough lungs are injured and  haemoptysis ensues and consequently debility arises. Thus these three dosas aggra- vated by irregular dieting produce phthisis. Having been afflicted with these wasting  complications, the patient gradually dries up. Hence the wise should take food which  is not irregular in terms of nature, preparation, combination, quantity, place time,  rules of dietitic use and suitability. Here is the verse- Observing many troublesome diseases caused by irregular dieting, the wise should  eat wholesome, measured and timely food with self-restraint. ",
2791,11-Oct,
2792," By regular use of these four etiological factors of phthisis vata, pitta and kapha  get vitiated. These vitiated dosas dry up the body with various complications.

Some say the inauspicious action done in previous life as its cause. That  also is caused by intellectual error thus said Punarvasu Atreya. Due to intellectual  error, the person disregarding the gods, sages, forefathers, gandharvas, yaksas,  raksasas, preceptors, elders, accomplished persons, teachers and other respectable  persons behaves unwholesomely, or performs other such inauspicious activities.

2904,15,
2905, Thus this excellent section on diagnosis is described wholly. Disease is also observed as serving the purpose of etiology in respect of (an- other) disease. Such as hyperpyrexia gives rise to internal haemorrhage which in turn  causes fever and both together give rise to phthisis. From enlargement of spleen arises  udararoga and from udara appears oedema. From piles arises terrible udararoga and  also gulma. Coryza gives rise to cough which produces wasting which results in cau- sation of phthisis. ,
2906,16-19,

2919,24-26,
2920," One symptom pertains to many diseases as well as one disease. Likewise, many  symptoms arise is one disease as well as many diseases. For instance, fever is the  (common) symptom of many diseases having irregular onset and complicated origin  while hyperpyrexia is the symptom of fever only. Many symptoms related to irregu- lar onset and complicated origin are found in fever while the same are observed also  in several diseases like fever, dyspnoea, hiccup etc. ",
2921,27-29,
2922," One pacificatory measure is useful in many disorders as well as in single disor- der. Likewise, many measures are required for a single disorder as well as multiple  ones. For instance, the single reducing therapy pacifies many disorders arisen from  amasaya and sometimes single disease (fever) responds to the single therapy (reduc- ing one). Likewise, several measures light diet etc. are prescribed in fever alone while  all these are applied in several disorders like fever, dispnoea, hiccup etc. ",

(1) One should eat unctuous; because it tastes well, eaten food stimulates the  unstimulated digestive fire, gets digested quickly, carminates flatus, develops the body,  provides firmness to sense organs, increases strength, produces clarity of complex- ion; hence one should eat unctuous. (2) One should eat in proper quantity. Food taken in proper quantity whithout dis- turbing vata, pitta and kapha only promotes life-span, easily passes dwon to anus,  does not disturb the (digestive) fire, gets digested with discomfort; hence one should  eat in proper quantity.

3035,5,
3036," The appropriate quantity is already said above according to division of the belly  which will be further explained here in detail. Such as-no obstruction in heart, no  pain in sides, no excessive heaviness in abdomen, saturation of sense organs, cessa- tion of hunger and thirst, ease in standing, sitting, lying down, movement, inspira  tion, expiration, laughing and gossiping, easy digestion (of food) in evening and morn- ing, promotion of strength, complexion and development-these are the characters of  the food taken in appropriate quantity. ",
3037,6,
3038," Inappropriate quantity is of two types-deficient and excessive. The food in  deficient quantity is said to be causing loss of strength, complexion and develop- ment, unsaturation, upward movement of vayu; harm to life-span, virility and  immunity; damage to body, mind, intellect and sense-organs, inflicting sara,  carrying inauspiciousness and causative factor for eighty disorders of vata.  Food in excessive quantity is said as vitiating all dosas by experts. When after  taking solid food upto the saturating point, liquids are taken upto the same, vata,  pitta and kapha situated in stomach pressed too much by the food in excessive  quantity get vitiated all simultaneously. These vitiated (dosas) entering into the  same undigested quantum of food get located in a portion of the belly and cause  distension of abdomen or suddenly being eliminated through upper or lower path  produce separately these symptoms in the consumer (of food in excessive  quantity). Vata produces colic pain, hardness in belly, body-ache, dryness of ",

These also cause over-affection of ama. ",

Food and drinks taken by the weak, one having  poor digestion and abundant kapha, who suppresses urges of flatus, urine and  faeces, and takes solid, heavy, excessively rough, cold and dry food; get pressed  by vayu and their passage being blocked by kapha and also due to excessively accu- mulated excreta does not tend to come out; then they exhibit excessively the symp- ",

Aggravated and viti- ated dosas, when their passage is blocked by over-vitiated ama and they move ob- liquely, sometimes stiffen the entire body like a staff. This (condition) is known as  'dandalasaka' which is incurable. The amadosa in those who habitually take antago- nistic food, meals when previous meal is not digested and meals during indigestion  is said as 'amavisa' (toxaemia due to ama) by physicians because it produces  symptoms like those of poisoning. This is exceedingly incurable because of its  emergent nature and contradictory management. ",
3055,12,
3056," The curable type of affected ama, if stagnant, should be eliminated through emesis  by administering hot saline water and then application of fomentation and supposi- tory keeping the patient on fast. In visucika, reducing measures are adopted in the  beginning and after management like that in purgation. In conditions of over-vitiation  of ama, during meal time, inspite of the previous meal having been digested if the  stomach is still coated with dosas, abdomen is cold and heavy and there is aversion to  food; drug should be administered for digestion of the remnant dosas and kindling of  (digestive) fire. The patient should never eat during indigestion. Agni weakened by  overvitiated ama is not capable of digesting the derangement, drug and food simulta- neously. Over and above, the faulty course of over-vitiated ama, food and drug, due  to over-strength, fells down suddenly the patient who is already weak and has lowered  body-fire. Cessation of the disorders caused by ama is managed with desaturating  therapy. If it continues further one should adopt appropriate measure contrary to  disease leaving aside that contrary to etiology for the control of diseases in which  desaturation has already been done. For control of all diseases, the experts recommend therapy contrary to cause  and disease or which serve their purpose. When the patient is relieved of the  over-affection of ama, his morbidity has been digested and digestion is stimulated, he ",

3099," Having heard the causes of epidemics Agnivesa again put a qurey to Lord Atreya-  Lord Atreya replied-the root cause of the derangement of all vayu etc. is  unrighteousness. That also arises from the misdeeds of the previous life but the source  of both is intellectual error. Such as-when the Heads of country, city, guild and  community having transgressed the virtuous path deal unrightneously with the people,  their officers and subordinates, people of the city and community, and traders carry  this unrighteouness further. Thus this unrighteousness by force makes the righteous- ness disappear. Then the people with righteousness having disappeared, are aban- doned even by gods. Consequently when righteousness has disappeared,  unrighteousness has the upper hand and the gods have deserted the place, the seasons  get affected and because of this it does not rain in time, or at all or there is abnormal  rainfall, winds donot blow properly, the land is affected, water reservoirs get dried  up and the herbs grving up their natural properties acquire morbidity. Then epidemics  break out due to polluted contacts and edibles. ",

For those having exalted mind, qualities and actions the crops grew endowed  with inconeivable rasa, vlrya, vipaka prabhava and other properties due to presence  of all qualities in the earth etc. in the beginning of krtayuga. At the declining of the  krtayuga, due to over-receiving there arose heaviness in bodies of these wealthy per- sons; heaviness of the body led to fatigue, lassitude, hoarding, holding and greed in  successive order (all this happened) in krtayuga itself. In Treta, greed gave rise to  malice, speaking lie, passion, anger, conceit, dislike, roughness, voilence, fear, in- fliction, grief, anxiety, excitement etc. successively. Thus during treta a quarter of  righteousness disappeared due to which there was reduction of a quarter in the yearly  duration of the yugas (ages) and consequent degradation of quarter in unctuousness,  purity, rasa, vipaka, prabhava and other propreties of the crops. Because of this the  bodies of the people due to intake of food degraded by a quarter in properties and  other behaviours were not resistent as earlier and as such were pervaded by agni (pitta)  and vata and were attacked first by diseases like fever etc. Thus the living beings  were gradually affected by decrease in their life-span.

After completion of one hundred years, there is a loss of one year in the life- span of the living beings in respective ages. Thus is said the initial origin of the disorders. ",

Daiva is the deed self-done in the previous  life while purusakara is that which is done here itself. In both these deeds also there  are grades of strength and otherwise. Accordingly the deed is of three types-inferior,  medium and superior. Coordination of both daiva and purusakara of the superior type  is the cause of long, happy and determined life-span while that of the inferior type is  the cause of the contrary (short, unhappy and undetermined life-span). In case of  medium type the result also is medium. Now listen to further arguments. ",

3129," Hence because both types of causes are observed one-sided view is not correct.  (I) will explain it with examples. If there be determined life-span for all there would  not be any necessity to apply mantras, herb-roots, gems, auspicious rites, offerings,  gifts, oblations, observance of rules, expiation, fasting, blessings, bowing, visit to  temples etc. with a desire for longevity nor there be any need to avoid excited, fierce  and moving cows, elephants, camels, asses, horses, buffalows and terrific winds etc.  Likewise, one would not abstain from water falls, mountains, uneven and difficult  places and strong water current, from careless, insane, excited, firece and unstable  persons and those inflicted with confusion and greed; from enemies, from furious  fire, from various poisonous reptiles, serpents etc. from over-exertion, from behaviour  unsuited to place and time, and from king's wrath, because these and other similar  factors should not be destructive because of entire life having determined span. Moreo- ver, the living beings who have not practised the alleviative measures against the  happening of untimely death should not be subjected to such happening; all the talks  of great sages for initiation and knowledge of application in the chapter of rasayana  would be useless; even Indra should not be able to kill with thunderbolt his enemy  with determined life-span; why should Aswins treat the patient with therapeutic meas- would also not be necessary for the great sages along with the lord of gods (Indra),  who already know the worth knowing, to see, to instruct and to behave properly. Excellent among all the visions is the one pertaining to Indra, which is pos- sessed by us as well, with this it is observed like this-there is dissimilarity in life- span of thousands of persons who are those not indulged in fighting battles; simi- larly in those who counteract or do not counteract the disease immediately after  it is arisen; there is also dissimilarity in life-span of those who take poison or not;  there is no similar fate of the jars carrying water and those in pictures (or kept  only for decoration). Hence wholesome regimen is the basis of life and the contrary  is that of death. Over and above, orderly and proper use of food and activities  which are contrary to the properties of place, time and self, abstaining from exces- 46C.S.-I ",

Such death is  (known as) timely.

Fever arises  from amasaya and in disorders arisen from amasaya the therapy mostly consists of  digestion, vomiting and desaturation. Hot water is (efficacious) for digestion. Hefcce,  physicians mostly advise it for the patient, of fever. This taken by those (patients)  carmintes wind, stimulates digestive fire, is quickly transformed, dries up mucus, even  taken in a little quantity is able to alleviate thirst. In spite of this, it should not be  given in fever with excessively aggravated pitta or having symptoms such as burning  sensation, giddiness, delirium and diarrohoea because burning sensation, giddiness,  delirium and diarrhoea are aggravated further by the hot while they are subsided by  the cold.

By reducing therapy agni and vata are increased which dry up the little dosas like the wind and the sun drying up the little water. The reducing cum/ digesting therapy is prescribed in case of dosas with medium strength. By this therapy,  the moderate dosas are dried up in the same way as the moderate quantity of water is  dried up by the sun-heat and wind and also by sprinkling dust and ashes. In case of  abundant dosas, only letting out of dosas is prescribed, there is no remedy for over- flowing of a small pool except by breaking down field barriers. The therapy of letting  out dosas works in the same way. ",

(The region which has little water and a few trees, strong winds and intense sun  is known as jamgala (hilly or arid). There occurs the least number of diseases. On the contrary, the region having abundant water and numerous trees, mild air  and scarce sun is anupa (marshy) which gives rise to plenty of dosas.

3169," Authority is the statement of the apta (credible persons). Aptas are those who  possess knowledge devoid of any doubt, indirect and partial acquistion, attachment  and aversion.

3174," Deciding a course of action becomes faultless if the entire disorder is examined  from all aspects priorly with the threefold sources of knowledge collectively, because  no knowledge is derived about the entire object by a part of its source. Out of these  three sources of knowledge, first of all knowledge is obtained from authority. There- after examination proceeds with perception and inference because if there be no  authoritative material beforehand what one would know from perception and  inference. Thus, for those who have knowledge (of authority) the examination is two  fold-perception and inference but for others it is threefold including authoritative  instruction. ",

If they eat it, it is pure blood otherwise  affected one-this should be known with inference. In this way, other tastes in body  parts may be inferred. Smell, normal or abnormal, in all body parts of the patient  should be examined with nose. Similarly the touch, normal or abnormal, with the  hand.

3199, There are types of srotas as many as corporeal entities. All (corporeal) entities  do not arise or decay without srotas. Srotas are defined as transporting passages of  dhatus undergoing transformation. ,
3200,3,
3201," Some hold that the person is only the aggregate of srotas because of their pervasi- veness and diffusiveness of agents aggravating and pacifying dosas. This is not so  because that which srotas belong to, which they carry, nourish and where they are  situated all this is different from the srotas themselves. Some say that srotas are innu- merable because they are many while others take them as numerable. ",

As regards vata, pitta and kapha, they move all  over the body with all the srotas serving the purpose of their passage. Similarly, for  mind etc. which are transcending sense organs the entire sentient body serves as pas- sage as will as location. As long as these srotas are normal, the body is not inflicted  with any disorder. ",

The symp- toms when they are affected are these such as-too long, too short, aggravated,  shallow or frequent, respiration with sound and pain indicate the affection of prana- vaha srotas. For udakavaha srotas, the origin is palate and kloma. The symptoms of their  affection are these such as by observing dryness of tongue, palate, lips, throat  and kloma and excessive thirst one should know that the udakavaha srotas are  affected. Annavaha srotas have their origin in amaSaya and the left side. The symptoms of  their affection are these-such as loss of desire for food, anorexia, indigestion and  vomiting indicate the affection of annavaha srotas. Rasavaha srotas have their root in hrdaya and ten dhamanls (vessels).  Raktavaha srotas have their root in liver and spleen. Mamsavaha srotas have  their root in ligaments and skin. Medovaha srotas have their root in Vrkka  (kidney) and omentum. Asthivaha srotas have their root in medas (fat) and but- tocks, majjavaha srotas have their root in asthi-sandhi and sukravaha srotas  have their root in testicles and penis.

Mutravaha srotas (channels carrying urine) have their root in basti and vanksana.  Symptoms of their morbidity are these-such as excessive excretion, excessive ob- struction or suppression, vitiated, diminished or frequent thick urine with pain indi- cate the morbidity of mutravaha srotas. Purisavaha srotas (channels carrying faeces) have their root in pakvasaya and  sthulaguda (rectum). Symptoms of their morbidity are these-such as passing faeces  with difficulty, in small quantity, with sound and pain, too liquid, too scabulous and  in large quantity indicate morbidity of the purisavaha srotas. Swedavaha srotas (channels carrying sweat) have their root in medas (fat) and  hair follicles. Symptoms of their morbidity are these-such as loss of perspiration,  excessive perspiration, coarseness, excessive smoothness, extensive burning sensa- tion and horripilation indicate the morbidity of the swedavaha srotas.

Due to morbidity of these (channels pertaining to  Sariradhatus) the sariradhatus whether in passage (under the process of transforma- tion) or in location (fully transformed state) also get affected.

Udakavaha srotas are affected due to heat, ama, fear, drinking, use of dry food  and suppression of thirst. Amavaha srotas are affected due to intake of food in excessive quantity, untimely  and which is unwholesome and derangement of agni. Those who eat heavy, cold, too unctuous and in excessive quantity and do ex- cessive mental work suffer from the morbidity of rasavaha srotas. Those who take food and drinks as causing burning, unctuous, hot and liquid  and also exposure to the sun and fire suffer from the morbidity of raktavaha srotas. Those who take channel-blocking, bulky and heavy food and also sleep during  day suffer from the morbidity of mamsavaha srotas. Medovaha srotas are affected due to lack of physical exercise, day-sleep, exces- sive intake of fatty food and alcoholic drinks. Asthivaha srotas are affected due to (excessive) physical exercise, too much jerk- ing; excessive rubbing of bones and constant use of vata-aggravating factors. Majjavaha srotas are affected due to crushing, excessive bath, injury, compres- sion and constant use of antagonistic food. Sukravaha srotas are affected due to sexual act in improper time and nonvaginal  track, suppression of discharge of semen, excessive coitus and (faulty) application of  surgery, alkali and agni (cauterizasion). Mutravaha srotas are affected due to use of water, food and coitus during urge  for micturation, suppression of urga for mictruation particularly in persons wasted  and wounded.

3236, CHAPTER VI Now (I) shall expound the specific features of the groups of diseases. ,
3237,1,
3238,  As propounded by Lord Atreya. ,
3239,2,
3240,"  There are two groups of diseases according to effect-curable and uncurable. Those  according to severity-mild and severe. Again there are two groups according to loca-  tion-phychic and somatic. Two groups according to etiology-innate (due to inbalance  of intrinsic factors) and exogenous. There are two groups according to site of origin-  originated from amasaya and that from pakvasaya. Thus though disease is divided  into two groups each according to effect, severity, location, etiology and site of ori- gin, it may be numerous being divided from various points of view and one being  united together. Singleness of disease syndrome is due to similarity of pain while  numerousness is due to division as into ten groups according to effect etc. Numerous- ness is also of two types-numerableness or innumberableness. Numerableness as ex- plained in the chapter on eight abdominal diseases and innumerableness as in the  chapter on great diseases due to innumerableness of pain, colour, causation etc. ",
3241,3,
3242," Here some statement may not be faulty because of variations in number of  groups according to different points of view, nor is it faultless if there are no such ",
3243,page_no:335 ,
3244,0,
3245," variations. The reason is that the classifier classifies the entity from various points of  view, thus he does not contradict if he classifies the entity, already classified earlier  from some point of view, from other points of view and finds various numbers of  groups. In case of similar dividing factor too, it is necessary to consider the refer- ence to the context because similar words have different meanings while different  synonyms have similar meaning-. For instance, the word 'roga' denotes dosas as well  as disorder. 'Dosa' has synonyms such as roga, atanka, yaksman, dosapraksti and  vikara; vyadhi also has got the same synonyms. Thus the word 'roga' is similar in  case of dosa as well as vyadhi while in other cases it is dissimilar. ",
3246,4,
3247,"1 Diseases are innumerable because of being too numerous while dosas are nu- merable because of being not too numerous. Hence (I) will explain the disorders  only as examples like pictures but will describe dosas fully. Rajas and tamas are the  two psychic dosas. They cause disorders like passion, anger, greed, confusion, envy,  conceit, narcosis, anxiety, excitement, fear, exhilaration etc. Vata, pitta and kapha  are the bodily dosas. They cause disorders such as fever, diarrhoea, swelling, phtisis,  dyspnoea, prameha, leprosy etc. Thus dosas are said in entirely while the disorders  partially. ",
3248,5,
3249," For both these (types of) dosas, there are three aggravating factors such as-  unsuitable contact of objects with sense organs, intellectual error and conse- quence. ",
3250,6,
3251, While vitiated they produce innumerable different disorders due to difierent vi- tiating factors and the dusya (affected entities). ,
3252,7,
3253, These (psychic and somatic) diseases sometimes continuing together are associ- ated mutually such as passion etc. and fever etc. ,
3254,8,
3255, ,
3256,page_no:336 ,
3257,0,
3258, There is constant association of rajas and tamas together because tamas can't  move on without (the help of) rajas. ,
3259,9,
3260, (Often) the bodily dosas. situated in one location combine together by either  sannipata (combination of all the three dosas together) or samsarga (combination of  two dosas together) because of having similar properties, dosas are similar to the  vitiating factors. 
3261,10,
3262," Now the difference between primary and secondary disorders-primary disorder  is that which is independent, has symptoms manifested, and etiology and remedy as  described while the secondary disorder is that having contrary characters. When dosas having characters of primary disorder combine all the three together  that is called as sannipata or if combine two together that is samsarga. Due to varia- tions inprimary and secondary characters there are numerous variations in dosas. Thus  the physicians attribute various nomenclatures to dosas and disorders classified in  different groups according to various factors. ",
3263,11,
3264," There are four categories of bodily fire (agni) according to intensity-such  as intense, mild, regular and irregular. Amongst them, the intense fire can tolerate  all sorts of improper regimen while the mild one has got the contrary character.  The regular fire gets affected by improper regimen but otherwise remains normal,  the irregular fire has got the character contrary to that of the regular fire. These  four types of fire are found in four types of persons. The persons having normal  constitution with vata, pitta and kapha in equilibrium have regular fire; in those  of vatika constitution, because of the seat of fire having been subdued by vata, fire  ",

3266,0,
3267," constitution, the seat of fire is subdued by kapha and the fire becomes mild. ",
3268,12,
3269," On this some say-""there are no persons having all the three dosas in equilibrium  because of the use of unbalanced food, thus some are having vatika constitution, some  physicians take the person having balanced vata, pitta and kapha as healthy, health is  normalcy and for the same object therapeutic measures are applied. Hence there are  (person having prakrti as) balanced vata, pitta and kapha but there are no prakrtis  (constitution) like vatika, paittika or kaphaja. Because of predominace of certain dosa  in person the respective dosaprakrti of the same is said, but as there can't be normalcy  in imbalanced dosas they can't be taken as prakrti. The concerned person can only be  respectively) and they all are in the state of abnormality. ",
3270,13,
3271," In respect of these four types of persons, four types of measures are beneficial.  In case of those having all the dhatus in balance, the measure balanced in all aspects  be adopted. In cases of other three having predominance of one or the other dosa, the  measures contrary to dosas, after considering the predominance of the respective dosa,  are beneficial till agni becomes regular. Thereafter balanced measure should be ap- plied. Similarly, observance of behaviour and application of remedy is advised in  these cases. These will be explained further in detail. ",

3277,15,
3278," If a vatala person uses vata-aggravating things, vata gets vitiated immediately,  not so the other two dosas (in spite of the presence of aggravating factor). The viti- ated vata inflicts the persons with the said disorders and leads to the loss of strength,  complexion, happiness and life. The measures overcoming (vata) are-properly ap- plied unction and fomentation, mild evacuative measures having unctuous, hot, sweet,  sour and saline drugs, similar dietitic regimen, massage, poultice, bandage, kneading,  bath, plunging (in water), gentle pressing, hard pressing, terrorising, creating sur- prise and forgetting, administration of wines and other fermented liquors, fats from  various sources added with appetisers, digestives, vata-alleviating and purgatives and  cooked hundred or thousand times for use in all ways, enema, prescribed regimen  alongwith it and comfortable living.

3279,16,
3280," When a pittala person uses pitta-aggravating factors, his pitta gets vitiated  immediately not so the other two dosas-that vitiated pitta inflicts his body with  the said disorders and leads to the loss of strength, complexion, hapiness and  life. Measures overcoming this are-intake of ghee, unction with ghee, elimation of  dosas downwards (purgation), use of sweet, bitter, astringent and cold drugs and diet,  use of soft, sweet, handsome, cold and pleasing perfumes, putting on chest the gar- lands of pearls and jewels dipped in too much cold water, sponging with water cooled ",

",
3284,17,
3285," If a slesmala person uses kapha-aggravating factors, his kapha is vitiated imme- diately and not so the other two dosas. That vitiated kapha inflicts his body with the  said disorders and leads to the loss of strength, complexion, happiness and life. The  measures overcoming it are-properly administered sharp and hot evacuatives, food  mostly rough and added with pungent, bitter and astringent things, running, jumping,  leaping, cyclic movements, vigils, fighting, sexual intercourse, physical exercise, press- ing, bath, annointing, frequent use of sharp and old wines, smoking, fasting, warm  clothes, abstinence from comforts leading to happiness itself.

3295,1,
3296, As propounded by Lord Atreya. ,
3297,2,
3298," There are two types of persons having appearance of the diseased. One is that  who though suffering from a severe disease appears to be suffering from a mild dis- ease because of the excellence of psyche, strength and body. The other is that who  though suffering from a mild disorder appears to be suffering from a severe disorder  because of the inferiority of psyche etc. the physicians who are not acquainted with  them fail to decide mildness or severity of the disease proceeding only on gross ob- servation of the patient.

3303," A part of the means of knowlege is not able to provide understanding of the  entire object. Those who fail to diagnose a case also fail to prescribe a rational rem- edy for the same. (For instance) when they take severely diseased as mildly diseased  and considering a little morbidity administer mild evacuative drug which further ag- gravates the dosas. (Likewise) when they take the mildly diseased as the severely  diseased and considering great morbidity administer strong evacuative drug which  harms the body by over-eliminating the dosas. Thus those who regard the part of the  means of knowledge as sufficient to provide knowledge of the entire object, fail in  their pursuit. (On the other hand) the physicians who know from all the aspects, never  confuse if they take action after examining the entire situation by all means as far as  possible and thus achieve the desired objective. ",
3304,4,
3305," Here are the verses- The inexperienced physicians confuse in deciding the severity or otherwise  of the disease by seeing only the appearance of the patient having variations due to  psyche etc. These ignorant ones, by administering remedies improperly, cause end of  the patient or some severe trouble. The learned ones, (on the other hand), after obtain- ing knowledge about the case by all means never slip in administration of remedial  measure. ",
3306,7-May,
3307," Thus after having heard the types of the appearance of the diseased, failure of  the ignorant physicians in this respect and its bad consequences, the invariable success  of the learned physicians in the context of the appearance of the diseased, Agnivesa  put query to Lord Atreya, bowing on his feet, about all parasites inhabiting the persons  in respect of etiology, location, form, colour, name, effect and treatment.

3313,9,
3314," Excreta are of two types-external as well as internal. By the word 'malaja' the  parasites growing in external excreta are taken. Their cause is avoiding cleanliness  (of the body); location-hairs, beards and mustaches, small hairs, eyelashes and  clothings; form-miunte, sesamum-shaped and multipede; colour-black and white;  name-yiika (lice), pipllika; effects-itching, urticarial patches and pimples, their rem- edy consists of extraction, removal of excreta and avoiding factors which promote  excreta. ",
3315,10,
3316," Those grown in blood have their etiology similar to that for leprosy; location-  blood vessels; form-minute, round and having no feet, some of them are invisible  because of their subtleness; colour-coppery; name-kesada, lomada, lomadwTpa,  saurasa, audumbara and jantumata; effects-falling of hairs, beard and mustaches,  nails, small hairs, eyelashes, when they infect a wound, (they cause) oversensitivity,  itching, piercing pain and creeping sensation, when excessively grown, they eat away  skin, blood vessels, ligaments, muscles and cartilage. Their remedy is also similar to  that for leprosy which will be described later on. ",

3322,12,
3323," The worms grown in faeces have etiology similar to that for those grown in  mucus; their location is pakwasaya (intestines); when developed they move  downwards, but in case they tend towards stomach, eructations and breath of the  patient have faecal odour; form and colour-some are minute, cylindrical, white, long,  like wool fibers; while the others are gross, cylindrical, blackish, blue, green and  yellow; their names are-kakeruka, makeruka, leliha, sasulaka, sausurada; effects-  diarrhoea, emaciation, roughness, horripilation; when they reach the anus, they  produce piercing pain and itching there; when they are exhilarated, they come out of  anus frequently. Thus these are the characteristics of the worms grown in faeces and  mucus in respect of their etiology etc. ",
3324,13,
3325," Their treatment will be mentioned here in brief which will be described in detail  later on. In all parasites first of all their extraction should be done, then destruction of  the source of their origin and development and thereafter abstinence from the etiology  factors. ",

3330," Now extraction is removal effected by hands with or without the help of instru- ments as necessary. Parasites located inside the organs are extracted, as a rule, by the  (eliminative) therapy. This is of four types such as head-evacuation, emesis, purga- tion and non-unctuous enema. This is the method of extraction. Destruction of the  source of their origin and development consists of the use of pungent, bitter, astrin- gent, alkaline and hot drugs, and other measures which are contrary to kapha and  faeces. This is about destruction of the source. Thereafter abstinence from the  etiological factors-whatever is mentioned as causative factor and similar other sub- stance should be avoided. Thus the principle of treatment is said, this is further de- scribed in detail. ",
3331,15,
3332," The patient infested with worms should be first treated with unction and fomen- tation for six or seven nights and a day before administering the evacuative therapy  he should be given diet morning and evening consisting mainly of milk, jaggery, curd,  sesamum, fish, meat of marshy animals, (rice) flour preparation, rice cooked in milk  and kusumbha oil in order to stimulate the worms and impel them to the alimentary  tract. After passing the night, when the patient is comfortable seated and has his  meal properly digested, the evacuative therapy-non-unctuous enema, emesis and pur- gation-should be administered to him the same day after examining all the aspects  properly.

The tolerably warm decoction  is added with the paste of the madanaphala pulp, vidanga, oil and swarjika salt and  put into the enema pot and with this non-unctuous enema should be administered to  the patient properly. This enema may be prepared also with the decoction of arka,  alarka, kutaja, adhakl, kustha and kaidarya, or of sigru, pTlu, dhanyaka, katuka and  sarsapa, or of amalaka, srngabera, daruharidra and nimba, in combination with  madanaphala etc. and is administered to the patient for three or seven days. ",
3338,17,
3339," After the last enema has come back the patient should be assured and on the  same day evacuative drugs acting from both ways be administered to him properly.  Its method is like this. One aksa (10 gm.) of the paste of trivrt mixed with half anjali (80 ml.) decoction  of the madanaphala pulp should be administered to the patient, this eliminates the  noxious material well from both ways. In this way the emetics and purgatives men- tioned in the kalpa section may be administered after taking into consideration all the  aspects. ",
3340,18,

After bath he should be admitted  to a room which is free from wind and should be managed with dietitic regimen  starting with yavagu (liquid gruel) cooked with pippalT, pippallmula, cavya, citraka  and sunthl.

Mixing the  flour of the red sali rice with this juice pupalika (cake) should be made and cooked  on smokeless charcoal. These cakes alongwith vidanga, oil and salt should be given  to the patient infested with parasites for eating. Afterwards he should be given to  drink the sour vinegar or diluted buttermilk mixed with five drugs of pippalyadi  group (pippall, pippalTmula, cavya, citraka, sunthT) with a little salt. In the same  way, cakes may be prepared in the juice of one of these drugs-Bhrngaraja, arka,  sahacara, nlpa, nirgundl, sumukha, surasa, kutheraka, gandlra, kalamalaka, parnasa,  ksavaka, phanijjaka, bakula, kutaja and suvarnaksirT. Moreover, cakes may be prepared  in the juices of kinihl, kiratatikta, suvaha, amalaka, harltakl and bibhltaka.

When it is observed that the cow dungs are well-burnt and the stony fruits of bhallataka  are freed from oil, the (upper) jar is taken out. Now from the lower jar the oil is  collected. It is mixed with double quantity of the powder of vidanga seeds and dried  up in the sun for the whole day. A dose of it is administered to the patient by which  he is purged well.

3380,"  The wise who wishes to be a physician should, first of all, examine the treatise  with reasoning keeping in consideration his seriousness or otherwise in the work,  result, after-effects, place and time. Various treatises on medicine are found in  society, from amongst them one should select that which is great, used by emi- nent and wise men, full of ideas, respected by authorities, intelligible and beneficial  to all the three types of disciples (dull, mediocre and intelligent), free from the  defect of repetition, coming down from the sages, with well-composed introduction,  discussion and conclusion, having firm base, free from week and difficult words,  having abundant expressions, with traditional ideas, devoted mainly to arriving at ",

He should have clear idea of the  subject, should have seen the practical applications, be skilful, amicable, pure, having  practical experience, well-equipped, possessing all the senses in normal condition,  acquainted with (human) constitutions, well-versed in courses of actions, having his  knowledge uncensured, free from conceit, envy, anger, forbearing, fatherly to disci- ples, having qualities of a good teacher and capable of infusing understanding. The  teacher possessing such qualities inculcates physician's qualities in his disciple in a  short time like the seasonal cloud providing good crop in a suitable land. ",
3386,4,
3387," i Having approached him one should, with a view to pleasing, treat him cautiously  like fire, god, king, father and mother. Thus through his pleasure having obtained  the knowledge of the entire treatise one should constantly make good efforts for  firm-ness of knowledge, excellence of expression, understanding of ideas and power  of speaking. ",
3388,5,
3389," The means for these are-study, teaching and discussion with specialists. ",
3390,6,
3391," This is the method of study-one having sound health and waiting for the exact  moment should get up in the morning or a little earlier and after finishing the essen- tial routines and ablution should bow down to the gods, sages, cow, brahmana,  preceptors, elders, accomplished persons and the teacher. Then sitting comfor- tably on even and clean ground should recite the aphorisms in order with clear voice ",

3395,7,
3396," Now the method of teaching-the teacher, having decided to teach should, first of  all, examine the disciple such as-one worthy of being taught should possess these  qualities. He should be calm, of noble nature, not indulged in mean acts, with good-  looking eyes, mouth and nasal ridge; having thin, red and clear tongue; with no ab- normality in teeth and lips, not speaking with nasal utterance, having restraint, with- out vanity, intelligent, endowed with reasoning and memory, with broad mind, born  in a family of physicians or having conduct like that, having insistence for truth, without  any deformity or impairment of senses, humble, un-haughty, having ability to under- stand essence of the ideas, without anger and addictions, endowed with modesty, pu- rity, good conduct, affection, dexterity and sincerity, interested in study, devoted to  understanding of ideas and practical knowledge without any distraction, having no  greed or idleness, compassionate to all creatures, following all the instructions of the  teacher and being attached to him.

This should be smeared with cow-dung, covered with sacred grass and bound  on porders with paridhi (paticular sticks for the purpose). Further it should be equipped  with the said articles such as sandal, water jar, silken garment, gold, golden vessel,  silver, jewel, pearl and corals and decorated with pure (intellect-promoting) eatables,  perfumes, white flowers, fried paddy, mustard and barley grains. Then attending to  the fire with the fuel-sticks made of palasa, ingudl, udumbara and madhuka while in  pure condition and facing eastward, as prescribed under the method of study, he should  offer oblations of honey and ghee to the fire reciting benedictory mantras first invok- ing Brahma, Agni, Dhanwantari, Prajapati, ASwins, Indra and sages, the authors of  the aphorisms and ending with 'swaha' three times each. ",
3406,11,
3407,"  The disciple should follow him. After offering oblations he should go round the  fire keeping it to the right side. Then brahmanas should recite 'swasti' (mantras pro- moting well-being). At the end, he should pay respects to the physicians (present in  the ceremony). ",

3412," Now the teacher should instruct him in presence of fire, brahmanas and phy-  sicians-you should live with celibacy, keeping beard and mustaches, speaking truth,  not eating meat, using pure and intellect-promoting things without envy and pos- sessing no weapons. You should never disobey my words except in case they lead  to king's wrath, loss of life, great unrighteousness and other such calamity. You  should always surrender to me, regard me as head, be submissive to me and follow  the course which is liked by and useful to me. You should live with me behaving  as son, servant and suppliant. You should move without haughtiness, carefully,  with mind concentrated, humbleness and constant vigilance, without jealousy and  with my permission. Whether permitted (or not) to move out, you should first  make effort, as far as possible, to collect things for the teacher. When you join the  medical profession and wish success in work, earnings of wealth, fame and heaven  after death, you should always think of the welfare of all the living beings keeping  cow and brahmana before. You should make effort to provide health to the pa- tients by all means. You should not think ill of the patients even at the cost of  your life.

Proper examination guides the wise about the initiation of and desisting from work,  hence the experts commend the examination. While examining the difference between  himself and the opponent one should also examine the merits and demerits of the  speaker propely-such as scriptural knowledge, understanding, retention, imagination  and eloquence these are the merits.

Again calling him one should say-""You should learn  for one year more, perhaps you have not learnt from a preceptor or it is sufficient for  you. The opponent, even defeated once, is taken as defeated and should not be enter- tained again.

His examination (is this)-Physician is  that who wins over the diseases, is expert in applying the ideas of the aphorisms and  knows the life (science) properly from all aspects. He should first of all examine  himself (introspect), desirous of performing balance of all dhatus and considering  the performance of act in qualified patients and with proper qualities of management  as to whether he is capable for the performance of the act. These are the qualities of  physicians endowed with which he is capable of bringing forth the balance of dhatus  such as-clear knowledge of theoretical ideas, practical knowledge, dexterity, purity,  skill, possession of equipments, normalcy of all sense organs, acquaintance with  ",

3605," Instrument is the medicament. Medicament is that which serves as equipment  for the physician making effort for effecting balance of dhatus particularly different  from the entities ending with procedure (original source, inclination, place, time and  procedure). From the point of view of agents employed, medicament or therapy is of  two types-spiritual and rational. In spiritual therapy incantation, roots, gems,  auspicuous rites, offerings, gifts, oblations, observance of rules, expiation, fasting,  blessings, bowing, visit to temples etc. are employed. In rational therapy, evacuative  and pacificatory measures as well as fruitful activities are employed. It is again of  two types according to form-material and non-material. The non-material therapy  includes upayas (devices other than drugs). Upaya means formless entity like  terrorising, creating surprise, forgetfulness, agitation, exhilaration, chiding,  threatening for murder, binding, inducing sleep, gentle massage etc. It also includes the  aforesaid means of treatment. The material therapy consists of drugs which are used for  emesis etc. The drug is examined in respect of nature (natural composition), properties,  action, habit, time and mode of collection, storage, processing, dosage, indications for  use, the constitution of the patient, and the effect on disorder, whether eliminates it or  pacifies it, any other drug of this type should have the same characters. ",
3606,87,
3607," The original source is imbalance of dhatus which is known by the emergence  of the disorder. Examination of this and the material cause of the disorder (dosas)  consists of the observation of the characters of their diminution or aggravation  and also of those denoting curability, incurability, mildness and severity of the  disorder.

3618," Place is land as well a patient. Land is examined for the knowledge about the  patient or the drug. For the knowledge about the patient (these things are considered)  such as-in what type of land the patient is born, grown or diseased; in that type of  land, the people mostly have such diet, behaviour, conduct, strength, mind, suitability  pathology, liking, disorders, wholesomeness and unwholesomeness.

3623," strength and morbidity. The variations in quantity of drugs according to the degree  of morbidity depend on the degree of strength, because if intensely potent drug is  administered suddenly by a physician having not examined properly, it may kill the  weak patient; the weak patients are not able to bear intensely potent drugs which are  predominent in agni and vayu or cauterization, application of alkali and surgical  operation. They may cause instantaneous death due to unbearble and over-intense  impulse of the drug. Keeping this in mind, the physicians treat the weak patients  with drugs which are unharmful, mild, delicate, heavy in progressive order, without  complication, and not creating any emergent condition, particularly ladies, because  they have unstable, soft, bare and timid heart, are mostly delicate, weak and  subordinate to others. On the other hand, the drug having low potency and applied  by one who had not examined properly in strong patients having severe disoders  becomes ineffective. Hence the patient should be examined in respect of prakrti  (constiution), vikrti (m orbidity), sara (constitution of dhatus), samhanana  (compactness), pramana (measurement), satmya (suitability), sattwa (psyche),  aharasakti (power of intake and digestion of food), vyayamaSakti (power of exercise)  and age for the knowledge of the degree of strength.

Dosa, one or more than one, which predominates in these factors, gets attached to  the foetus. This is said as 'dosaprakrti' (physical or dosika constitution) of human  beings emerged from the initial stage of foetus.

3641, In persons having equilibrium of all dhatus the characters of all of them are  found. Thus one should examine in respect of constitution. ,
3642,100,
3643," A patient has to be examined in respect of vikrti as well. Vikrti is vikara (disor- der) or pathological manifestation. The disorder should be examined in terms of the  strength of cause, dosa, dusya, constitution, place, time and also by  symptoms, because the severity of disease can not be known without knowing the  strength of cause etc. The disease having strength similar to that of dusya, constitution,  place and time alongwith great strength of cause and severity of symptoms is taken as 53 C.

But it is observed that some persons having small body  and leanness are strong like the small ants carrying a big load. Hence one should  examine (the patient) in respect of essence. ",
3677,115,
3678," One should also examine by Samhanana (compactness). Samhanana, samhati and  samyojana are synonyms. A well compact body is known by evenly well-demarcated  bones, well bound joints, well formed muscles and blood.

3683," One should also examine by measurement. The measurement of the body  (anthropometry) will be described by the measure of individual fingers in terms of  height, breadth and length respectively. Feet are four (H.) six (B) and fourteen (L.)  fingers; shanks are eighteen fingers long and with sixteen fingers circumference;  knees four fingers long with sixteen fingers circumference, thighs eighteen fingers  (long) with thirty fingers circumference; testicles six fingers long with eight fingers  circumference; penis six fingers long with five fingers circumference; vulva with  twelve fingers circumference; waist sixteen fingers broad, bastisira ten fingers,  abdomen ten fingers broad and twelve fingers long; sides ten fingers broad and twelve  fingers long interval between the breasts twelve fingers, margins of the breasts two  fingers, chest twenty four fingers broad and twelve fingers high, (apex of the) heart  two fingers, blades six fingers, arms sixteen fingers (long), forearms fifteen fingers  (long); hands twelve fingers (long), axillae eight fingers, sacral region twelve fingers  high, back eighteen fingers high, neck four fingers high with twenty two fingers  circumference; face twelve fingers high with twenty four fingers circumference; mouth  five fingers; chin, lips, ears, middle of the eyes, nose and forehed four fingers; head  sixteen fingers high with thirty two fingers circumference. Thus measurement of body  parts is said separately. The entire body measures eighty four fingers in height and  also in breadth (with both the hands extended). The persons having normal  measurement of the body are endowed with longevity, strength, immunity, happiness,  supremacy, wealth and other desired qualities. Those having body with less or more  measurement have qualities contrary to those. ",
3684,117,
3685," One should also examine in respect of satmya (suitability). Suitable is that  which being used constantly has wholesome effect, those suited to ghee, milk, oil  and meat-soup, and to all rasas are strong, enduring and long-lived. On the  contrary, those suited to rough diet and single rasa are often weak, un-enduring, ",
3686,page_no:382 ,
3687,0,
3688, short-lived and with a little means. Those having mixed suitability have medium  strength. ,
3689,118,
3690," One should also examine in respect of sattwa (psyche). Sattwa is known as mind.  It controls the body by conjunction with the self. Psyche is of three types according to  strength-superior, medium and inferior. Accordingly the persons are also (of three  types) having superior, medium and inferior psyche. Amongst them, those having su- perior psyche are, in fact, sattwasara (with sattwa as essence) and have been described  in context of saras. They, though possessing short body, are seen unmoved even in  severe afflictions-innate or exogenous-due to predominance of sattwa quality. Those  having medium psyche sustain themselves at the instance of others or entirely by  others. But those possessing inferior mind can sustain neither by themselves nor by  others, although having big stature, they are unable to endure even mild pain, they are  associated with fear, grief, greed, confusion and conceit; and even during fierce, fright- ening, disliked, disgusting and ugly narratives or on the look of the animal or human  flesh or blood get afflicted with anxiety, abnormal complexion, fainting, insanity,  giddiness or falling on the ground or even succumb to death. ",
3691,119,
3692, One should examine in respect of aharaSakti (power of assimilation). This is  examined by the power of ingestion as well as digestion. Strength and life depend  on diet. ,
3693,120,
3694, One should also examine in respect of Vyayamasakti (power of exercise). The  power of exercise should be examined by the capacity for work. The three types of  strength are inferred from, the capacity for work. 
3695,121,
3696, ,
3697,page_no:383 ,
3698,0,
3699," One should also examine in respect of age. Age is defined as the state of body  corresponding to the length of time. Age is broadly divided into three stages-child-  hood, middle age and old age. Childhood is determined upto sixteen years when the  dhatus are immature, sextual characters are not manifested, the body is delicate,  unenduring, with incomplete strength and predominant in kapha dhatu. This again  with dhatus in developing stage and unstable mind remains upto thirty years. The  middle age is characterized by strength, energy, virility, prowess, acquisition, reten- tion, recollection, speech, understanding and qualities of all dhatus having reached  the normal limit; with proper physical and mental strength, without degeneration in  qualities of dhatus, with predominance of pitta dhatu and is upto sixty years. There- after is the old age upto one hundred years. During this period dhatus, sense organs,  strength, energy, virility, prowess, acquisition, retention, recollection, speech and  understanding gradually degenerate, qualities of dhatus go down and there is pre- dominance of vayu. During this age, the measure of life-span is one hundred years.  There are persons who live longer or shorter than that, in such cases, one should  determine the three divisions of age on the basis of strength of the factors like prakrti  etc. (except vikrti) and also characters of different periods of life-span. ",
3700,122,
3701," Thus one should determine the strength of the entities like Prakrti etc. (except  vikrti) in three divisions-superior, medium and inferior. According to severity of  vikrti (morbidity) the three degrees of strength of dosas are inferred. Then dividing  the medicament also into three degree, e.g. strong, mild and moderate, one should  apply them according to dosas. ",

3707,124,
3708," Time is the year as well as the status of the patient. The year is divided into  two, three, six, twelve or even more parts according to the nature of action (to be  taken). Now, dividing it into six, the action will be said. Hemanta (early winter),  grlsma (summer) and varsa (rainy season) these are the three seasons character- ised by cold, heat and rains. In between them there are other three seasons having  common characters such as-pravrt (early rains), sarad (autumn) and vasanta  (spring). Pravrt denotes the early rains, varsa is the continuation of the same.  Thus these six divisions of seasons have been made for the purpose of evacuative  therapy. ",
3709,125,
3710," Evacuative therapy such as emesis etc. is applied in seasons having common char- acters and are stopped in other seasons. The seasons having common characters are  the most convenient ones and unharmful to body and drugs because of moderate cold,  heat and rains, while others, due to excessive cold, heat and rains are inconveneint  ones and harmful to body and drugs.

3715," During hemanta (early winter) the body is affected by excessive cold and as  such is distressed, exposed to excessively cold wind, is too much roughened, and  with dosas adhered; on the other hand, the drugs administered for evacuation are hot  by nature which become mild in potency due to exposure to excessively cold wind.  Hence in conjunction of both these, the evacuative therapy becomes ineffective and  the body is inflicted with the complications of vata. During the summer season, the body afflicted by excessive heat becomes dis- tressed, exposed to excessively hot winds, too much lax and with excessively liqui- fied dosas; the drugs, on the other hand, administered for evacuation being hot in  nature become more intense because of exposure to heat; hence in conjunction of both  these, the evacuative therapy produces effects in excess and the body also gets com- plication of thirst. During the rainy season, when sky is pervaded with cloud and water, the sun,  the moon and the stars are hidden and there are torrential rains. The earth is covered  with mud and water; the body of living beings in moistened and the entire herbal  wealth is damaged in nature, the evacuative measures become dull in action and the  human bodies sluggish in recovery due to exposure to wind associated with moisture  and clouds. Therefore, the measures like emesis etc. are stopped in the season ending with  the rains (early winter, summer and rainy seasons) except in case of emergency. In  emergency too, one should administer the therapy with great care after modifying the  seasonal effects sufficiently by artificial means producing qualities contrary to the  season, and by making the measure appropriate in standard potency with variations  in combination, processing and quantity. ",
3716,127,
3717," The status of the patient is also called as timely or untimely in relation to the  act being performed or not such as, in a certain condition one drug is untimely,  and the other one is timely. This is, also due to specific condition, hence the  nomenclature of 'kala' (timely) and 'akala' (untimely) is given to the conditions  of the patient. This is examined like this-the physician should observe all the  conditions of the patient again and again in order to administer the correct therapy.  54 C . S.-1 ",
3718,page_no:386 ,

3720, The therapy administered after or before the (opportune) time is not effective because  time determines the sufficiency of the administration of therapy. ,

3725,130,
3726, Thus these ten entities should be examined separately. ,
3727,131,
3728, The object of examination is 'Pratipatti' (to decide the course of action). 'Pratipatti'  is the knowledge of treatment with which the disorder is to be effected. ,

3730, The condition in which emesis etc. are indicated or contra-indicated will be de- scribed in detail in siddhi section later on. ,
3731,133,
3732, In case where symptoms of both indication and contra-indication are conjoined  one should decide in either way on basis of predominance or otherwise. The diseases  are mentioned in treatises in respect of their treatment as general rule or exception.  Hence it is said that one should take action after considering the predominance or  otherwise. ,

3811," Mind is defined as the entitity which, even on contact with self, sense organs and  sense objects, is responsible for production or otherwise of knowledge by its attend- ing or non-attending respectively. Subtleness and oneness are known as two qualities  of mind. ",
3812,18-19,
3813," The object of thinking, analysing, reasoning, meditating, determination and what- ever, is to be perceived by mind is its object. Action of mind consists of control over  senses, self-restraint, reasoning, analysing. Beyond that is the jurisdiction of buddhi  (intellect). ",

3818, The sense-object is received by sense organs alongwith mind. Then the mind  analyses it in forms of merits or demerits and forwards it to Buddhi (intelect) which  produces decisive knowledge by which one proceeds to speak or to do something  with full knowledge. ,
3819,22-23,
3820, The five sense organs are composed of five mahabhutas (Akasa etc) with pre- dominance of one in each. They are known by inference through their actions and it is  they on the basis of which intellect proceeds. ,

The true speech is light while the false speech  is darkness. ",

Due to  contact of each of the self, sense organs, mind and sense object and according to  difference of the act, sense organs and objects, there are numerous products of intel- lect. As the sound produced by the contact of finger and the surface of the thumb and  also by that of wiry violin and nails varies numerously so is the product of intellect  emanated from the contacts. ",

3850, By the continuous process of transformation other similar new products are  evolved which are not in the original identity but because of similarity are taken as  the same.

The menstrual blood obstructed by vayu in a women is taken as pregnancy  sometimes by the ignorant. The blood not flowing out and gradually accumulated  produces signs and symptoms of pregnancy. When that blood is discharged out  due to exposure to fire, the sun, exertion, anxiety, other diseases and intake of hot  food and drinks, some people observing the same, though it is not foetus, say it as  destroyed by the evil spirit. The body (of the foetus) is not desired for the purpose  of eating by those (evil sprits) eating away ojas and moving in nights.

When the zygote is bifurcated with dominance of sperm the  women delivers male twin jointly or with that of ovum she delivers female twin  jointly.

Vayu having afflicted the location of semen in the foetus causes  pavanandriya (devoid of semen). When vayu obstructs the passage of the location of  semen, it causes samskaravahi (conditioned aphrodisia). When the parents have slug- gish and diminished reproductive factor, are weak, unstimulated and with damaged  genetic portion, they cause the two disorders-male and female sterility. Due to moth- er's lack of desire (for coitus) or complicated posture (during coitus) and also due to  genetic deficiency of father, vakrl (with curved organ) is caused. Trsyabhirati is caused  if the parents are subdued by jealousy and have mild passion. When the testicles get  destroyed by aggravation of vayu and agni, vatika sandhaka is produced.

Four bhutas are derived from  past deeds which having merged with the self enter into the foetus because the self  with seed-like character always transmigrates himself from one body to the other (in  a cyclic order).

It grows with the utilisation of suitable  nourishment and managed properly, devoid of abnormality. Then at the proper time,  while endowed with all the sensory organs, well developed body and excellence of  strength, complexion, mind and compactness, it is delivered with ease. The embryo  is produced by the aggregate of these factors as Lord Atreya said-the embryo is  produced by mother, father, self, suitability and nutrition and mind is also there as  an associate. ",
4059,3,
4060," suitability, use of nutrients in various forms such as-drinkables, eatables, chewable  and lickables, produces embryo nor does mind descend from the other world into the  embryo. ( 1) If the parents were capable of producing the embryo, the majority of men and  women who have longing for sons should produce sons only by cohabiting with the  desire therefor or those desiring daughters should produce the same. Moreover, none  of the men and women should be childless nor should such persons be aggrieved (be- cause of having no progeny). ( 2) ",

Because the born self can't produce himself as he is already there and how would the  unborn one would do as he is non-existing, hence in both ways it is illogical. Moreo- ver, suppose, the self is capable of producing himself, why does he not give birth only  in desired species and also as endowed with supreme power, unobstructed movements,  power of taking forms at pleasure, brilliance, strength, speed, complexion, psyche  and compactness and also as devoid of old age, disease and death, because the self  wants himself to be like this or even better. (3) The embryo is also not caused by suitability because if it were so, the persons  using suitable things alone should get progeny and on the other hand, those using  unsuitable things should be wholly childless but both are seen in both cases. ",
4064,4,
4065," The embryo has also no causal relation with nutrition because in that case  none of the men and women should be childless as there is none who does not take  nutrition. If it is meant that excellence of nutrition produces embryo, then the  persons using the meat of goat, sheep, deer and peacock, cowmilk, curd, ghee,  honey, oil, rocksalt, sugarcane juice, green gram and sali rice alone should get  offspring; and those eating syamaka, varaka, uddalaka, koradusaka, tubers and  roots (inferior cereals and edibles) should be wholly childless. But both are seen  in both cases. (5) Not also the psyche descends from the other world into the embryo because in  that case nothing of the past life should be unknown, unheard or unseen but it does  not remember anything.

He entering into the uterus and combining with sperm and ovum  produces himself in the form of embryo that is why the embryo is called as 'the self  The birth of that self is not possible because of his beginninglessness. Hence (both  the statements that) he produces the unborn embryo while born and unborn are in- correct. The same foetus by the lapse of time attains the stages of childhood, youth  and old age gradually. During the stage which he exists in, he is called as born (or  become) while during the preceding stage he was would be born (or become). In this  way, he is both born and unborn simultaneously. Where both these-bornness and  unbornness-are present he is produced while born and the same in future conditions  produces himself while unborn. In fact, birth is only transformation in respect of age  and conditions. For instance, in spite of sperm, ovum and the self, they do not attain  the state of embryo until they are combined together; this comes into existence by  combination. Similarly,, the same person does not attain fatherhood before the birth of  progeny which thereafter does. In the same way, the embryo, though existing, is said  as born or unborn in respective stages. [ 8] Mother, father or the self are not able to effect at pleasure in respect of all enti- ties of the embryo. Somewhat they do by themselves and other under the influence  of the past deed, at some places their instruments are potent while at others they are  not. Where there is excellence of instruments like psyche etc. they produce effect at  pleasure according to strength otherwise the results are contrary It does not mean  that due to defect of instrument, the self himself has no effective role in production  of embryo because the knowers of the self have observed that the desired species,  supreme power and emancipation are dependent on the self. There is none else agent  of happiness and misery. The embryo while being born can not be produced by the  factor other than the self. The sprout can not grow from non-seed (that which does not posess the character of seed). ",

[ 10] The embryo is produced from suitability. No factor other than the use of unsuit- able things causes sterility in men and women nor is there any abnormality in the  embryo. Three dosas even vitiated and spreading over the body in men and women  using unsuitable things do not affect the conception of embryo until sperm, ovum and  uterus are damaged. On the other hand, in men and women using suitable things and  even though having sperm, ovum and uterus undamaged and cohabiting in opportune  period, conception does not take place because of nondescent of the life-principle.  The embryo is produced not only from suitability alone but from the aggregate of all  the factors. The enitities derived from the suitability are these such as-freedom from  diseases, illness, and greed; cheerfulness of senses, excellence of voice, complexion  and reproductive factor (sperm and voum), and excessive stimulation (these are de- rived from suitability). [ 11] Embryo is produced from nutrition. Without nutrition even survival of the mother  would not be possible what to speak of the growth of embryo.

The psyche is of three types-pure, rajasa and tamasa. The quality which is  dominant in mind associates in the subsequent birth as well. In case the psyche is  pure, one recollects the (incidents of) the previous birth also. This sort of recollective  knowledge comes forth by the association of mind with the self on the basis of which  the person is said as 'Jatismara' (one who recollects the previous life). The entities  which are derived from the psyche are these such as-inclination, conduct, cleanliness,  aversion, memory, attachment, detachment, envy, valour, fear, anger, drowsiness,  vigour, intensity, softness, seriousness, instability and other psychic features which  will be described later on in the context of classification of psyche. Psyche is of  various types which are found all in a person but not simultaneously. One psyche is  said because of dominance of one or the other type. ",

4087," Thus the embryo is produced from the aggregate of all these factors. For instance,  the roof-chamber from the aggreggate of several materials and the chariot from com- bination of several parts. Therefore, I said-the embryo is produced from mother, fa- ther, self, suitability and nutrition and the psyche as an associate in this act. (as said  Lord Atreya). ",

4090," Bharadwaja again asked-if the embryo is produced from these various pro-  that as man is born of a man, it takes the human shape such as cow is born of a  cow, horse of a horse and so on; the earlier proposition that it is made of aggregate  would become untenable. If man is born of a man, why are the offsprings of the  dull, blind, hunch-backed, dumb, dwarf, with nasal utterance, freckles, insanity,  self perceives visions with his own visual organ, sounds with the auditory organ,  smell with the olfactory organ, taste with the gustatory organ, touch with the tactile  organ and knowables with the intellect and as such the offsprings of the dull etc.  are not similar to their parents, then it would go in contradiction of the proposition  itself. In this case, the self, in presence of the sense organs, will be conscious  otherw ise unconscious and that self where both conscious as well as  unconsciousness exist, will become changeable. If the self perceives the objects  with the visual organs etc., then in the absence of these organs he would not perceive  the sense objects and thus would be unconsious and thereby non-cause which would  destroy the basis of the self. Thus this proposition would be reduced to mere  jugglary of words and quite meaningless. (Thus said Bharadwaja). ",

4095," Atreya replied-It is already said earlier that the psyche associated with the life-  principle comes in contact with the body. How the embryo is formed in human shape  from the aggreggate and man is born of a man is explained hereunder. There are four  types of genetic source of animals-Jarayu (foetal memberances), egg, sweat and  coming out of the earth. Of these four classes, each class has innumerble variations  because of innumerable shapes of creatures. In cases of viviparous and oviparous  animals, these procreative factors attain the shape according to the species where  they operate. For instance, gold, silver, copper, tin and lead poured into respective  moulds of beewax (make various products), when they are poured into the man- shaped mould the product will be in the human form. In the same way, the embryo  produced from the aggreggate attains the human form. It is observed that man is  born of a man because of his belonging to the human species. ",
4096,16,
4097," As to the query that if man is born of a man why the offsprings of the dull etc. are  not similar to their parents it is said that in the seed (sperm or ovum), the part of the  body which is damaged in its genetic source gets abnormality otherwise not. Hence  both types of cases are observed. The sense organs of all are self derived and their  presence or absence is dependent on fate. Therefore, the offsprings of the dull etc. are  not invariably similar to their parents. ",
4098,17,
4099,This is not a fact that the self is conscious in presence of sense organs otherwise  not because the self is never dissociated with the psyche and from a particular psyche  a particular knowledge in acquired. ,

4124," (Now) the order in which the embryo is formed is explained. After the accumu- lated menstrual blood is discharged and the new one is situated, the woman having  cleanly bathed and with undamaged genital passage, ovum and uterus is called as  having opportune period. When the man having undamaged sperms cohabits with such  a woman, his semen, the essence of all the sarlradhatus, is extracted from the whole  body impelled by orgasm. Thus being impelled by the self in the form of orgasm and  also seated by him, the semen having potentiality of a seed, is ejaculated from the  man's body and through the proper track enters into the uterus and combines with  the ovum. ",
4125,7,
4126," There, first of all the principle of consciousness comes forward alongwith psy- che to receive the qualities (of mahabhutas). He is hetu, karana, nimitta (cause), aksara  (un-decaying), karta (doer), manta (thinker), vedita (perceptor), boddha (knower),  drasta (seer), dharta (sustainer), brahma (creator) viswakarma (performing universal  function), viswarupa (taking universal forms), purusa (lying in the body), prabhava  grahana (receiver), (pradhana (principal), avyakta (umanifest), jiva (life-principle),  Jna (conscious), pudgala (ego), cetanavan (having sensation), vibhu (omnipresent),  bhutatma (essence of creatures), indriyatma (essence of sense organs) and antaratma  (inner essense). At the time of receiving the qualities, he, first of all, takes up akasa.  As the undecaying self with desire to create the beings at the end of the final  destruction) (of creation) creates, with the psyche as instrument, first of all, akasa  thereafter gradually the other four elements vayu etc. having more manifest qualities.  At the time of putting on the body also he takes up akasa itself first of all and then  the other four elements vayu etc. with more manifest qualities gradually. The entire  process of receiving the qualities (of mahabhutas by uniting with them) is completed  within a subtle measure of time. [83 ",

4132,11,
4133," Some of the body parts have already been said earlier classified as maternal etc.  Now these will be mentioned alongwith some other entities from the point of view of  the products of the mahabhutas. In fact, the maternal etc. are also the products of the  mahabhutas. Those derived from akasa are sound, the auditory organ, lightness, mi- nuteness, distinction. Touch, the tactile organ, roughness, impulsion, shaping of dhatus  and physical activities are derived from vayu. Those derived from tejas are vision, the  visual organ, light, digestion and heat; those derived from ap are taste, the gustatory  organ, coldness, softness, unction and moistening; those derived from prthivl are smell,  olfactory organ, heaviness, stability and mass.

This is the normal pattern other- wise abnormal. In the foetus, some entities are permanent while others are temporary.  His body parts which are manifested carry the features of female, male or enunch.  The characteristic features of female and male depend on the self or the mahabhutas  and are determined according to the dominance of one or the other factor such as-  want of valour, timidity, lack of skill, confusion, instability, heaviness in lower parts,  intolerance, laxity, tenderness, genetic factor for uterus and other similar entities de- termine the female sex, contrary to these determine the male sex, the characteristics  of both types denote the enunch.

His heart which is maternally derived gets  connected with the mother's heart through vessels carrying nutrition. Hence their  desire is transmitted through them. Due to this reason it is not desirable to ignore  the (desire of) foetus expressed through the mother. In case the same are ignored,  there may be destruction or morbidity (in foetus). At this stage, the mother be- comes equal to the foetus for acquisition and maintenance in respect of certain  things. Therefore, the wise manage the pregnant (lady) with liked and wholesome  things.

The elders also advise  like this-she should not wear red clothes in order to prevent the (attacks of) gods,  demons and their followers, she should not take intoxicating wines, ride over vehicles,  eat meat, should abstain completely from the things which are unfavourable to all  the sense organs and such others which (elderly) women know (and advise).

When a woman uses aggravating factors, the dosas get vitiated  and in course of spreading reach the ovum and uterus but donot affect them entirely.  She conceives but the foetus gets damaged in one or more maternally derived organs;  that part is affected with morbidity in the gene, wholly or partially, of which the  dosas are vitiated. When in its ovum the gene concerned with uterus is damaged, the  progeny becomes sterile; when a part of this gene is affected, a putrified child is born.  When alongwith the latter abnormality a portion of the genes concerning the female  characters relating to body is also affected, the progeny will be predominantly fe- male-shaped but not female actually named as 'varta1 . These are the morbidites due to  affection of the female genes. ",
4180,30,

4239," Thereafter Agnivesa further put the query-what is the source of inclination, what  Lord Atreya replied-the sources of inclination are ignorance, desire, aversion  and action. Inclination, in turn, gives rise to ahankara, sanga, samsaya, abhisamplava,  abhyavapata, vipratyaya, avisesa and anupaya which overcoming the person engulf  him due to which he becomes unable to transcend the worldly existence like a tender  tree subdued by big and excessively branching trees. Ahankara (ego) is the feeling that ""I belong to such high clan and possess excel- lence of wealth, conduct, intellect, modesty, learning, fame, age, prowess and  influence"". Sanga (attachment) consists of the mental, vocal or physical actions which are  not conducive to emancipation. Samsaya (doubt) such as the result of the past deeds, emancipation, persons and  after-life exist or not. Abhisamplava is the wrong identity of the Self with the body when the per- son feels that in all conditions there is none else than myself, I am the creator, I  am perfect by nature and I am the aggregate of body, sense organs, intellect and  memory. Abhyavapata is the sense of ownership or self-based attachment such as  mother, father, brother, wife, children, kins, friends and servants are mine and I  am theirs.

Out of them the constituents having heavi- ness are increased by the prolonged use of heavy food items while those having light- ness are decreased. On the other hand, the lightness is increased by the light food  items and the heaviness is decreased. In this way, all properties of the constituents are  increased by the use of similar substances and decreased by that of the contrary ones.  Hence flesh is increased more in comparison with the other dhatus by (the use of)  flesh, similarly, blood by blood, fat by fat, muscle-fat by muscle-fat, bone by carti- lage, bone marrow by bone marrow, semen by semen and foetus by immature foetus  (egg).

Thereafter some unction is performed through the pas- sage of hair follicles and partilly through the path of umbilical cord. The cord is  attached to the umbilicus, placenta is attached to the cord on one side and to the  mother's heart on the other. Mother's heart floods the placenta (with nutritive fluid)  through the pulsating blood vessels. That nutrition provides strength and complex- ion as it contains all essential factors. In pregnant woman, nutrition takes three  courses-first for the nourishant of her own body, the second for loctation and the  third for the growth of foetus. Sustained by that nutrition, it carries on within the  womb (dependent on mother). ",

4538," While the steps are being taken to expel the placenta, the following actions should  be performed in respect of the newly born child, such as-rubbing of stone pieces at  the root of the ears, sprinkling of cold or hot water over the face, thus he recovers the  vital breath stopped due to distress so far. If the foetus is devoid of movements, he  should be fanned with a winnowing basket having black flaps till he recovers, (all the  above measures may be employed). When he recovers the breath and becomes nor- mal, he should be bathed and cleaned well with water. Thereafter, his palate, lips, throat and tongue should be cleansed with the help  of a finger having nail well-cut and putting a well-washed, cushioned cotton swab.  After washing his mouth, his anterior fontanel in head should be covered with a  cotton swab soaked in some fatty substance. Then vomiting should be induced by  administering ghee added with rock salt. ",

After fixing the point at eight fingers from the unbilical attachment the cutting point  should be held tightly on both sides and cut with a sharp, half-edged instrument made  of gold, silver or steel. The end of the attached portion should be tied with thread and  attached loosely to the neck of the foetus. If the cut portion suppurates, it should be  massaged with the oil prepared with the paste of lodhra, madhuka, priyahgu, devadaru  and haridra. The powder of the above drugs may also be applied over the part. Thus  the processing of the cord is described well. ",

This should be treated, according to severity, with massage, annointing and bathing   with ghees which are free from burning effect and are able to alleviate vata and   pitta. ",

The seeds of mustard, linseed, rice and kanakanika should be scattered   all over the maternity home. The oblation of offering of rice to the fire should be   performed continuously twice a day till the naming rite is solemnised. At the door   after the threshold a  wooden pestle should be-kept obliquely. A cloth packet con- taining vaca, kustha, coraka, hingu, mustard, linseed, garlic, kanakanika and other   drugs repelling evil spirits and well-tied should be kept at the front door.

Moreover, gifts, auspicious  rites, blessings, praises, songs, playing musical instruments should be performed  continuously in the home which should be amply provided with food and drinks and  be full of affectionate and happy persons. The brahmana proficient in the Atharvaveda  too should continuously offer propitiatory oblations to the fire both the times for the  well-being of the child as well as the mother. Thus the protecctive measures are said. ",

After she has taken the fat, her  abdomen should be massaged with ghee and oil and wrapped round with a big clean  cloth bandage so that vayu may not find space to produce disorder. After the fat is  digested, she should take in proper quantity liquid gruel prepared with pippalT etc.  and added well with unctuous substance. She should take sprinkles with warm water  both the times before the intake of fat and gruel. Thus maintaining for five or seven  days she should be saturated gradually.

Then the baby having been placed on the  pack of undamaged cloth should be admitted with his head towards the east or the  north. Thereafter father of the baby should say that the child is offering salutation to  the deity and brahmanas and having said so, the child should be given two names-one  based on the constellation at the time of his birth and the other popular name for day  to day use. Of them, the popular name should begin with ghosa (sonant) alphabets and  end with antastha (semi-vowel) or usma ones. Besides, there should not be a letter  with vrddhi (diphthong), it should be similar to that in preceding generations and  should not be newly established.

Measures  should be applied after considering the specific morbidity of the breast-milk. Ad- ministration of the decoction of patha, sunthl, devadaru, musta, murva, guduci,  indrayava, kiratatikta, katukarohinT and sariva is commended in these disorders.  Moreover, the use of other bitter, astringent, pungent and sweet drugs is recom- mended keeping in view the specific disorder, dosage and time. Thus galacto-depurant  measures are said. ",

In case of health, he should be maintained on the code of conduct for the healthy  using the things contrary to place, time and his self-constitution. The unwholesome  habits should be changed gradually to the wholesome ones and thus all unwholesome  should be avoided. Thus he attains the excellence of strength, complexion, body and  life-span.

4622,2,
4623," The following entities should be examined by the physician desiring to know  the remaining span of life with perception, inference and authoritative statements  such as complexion, voice, smell, taste, touch, visual organ, auditory organ, olfac- tory organ, gustatory organ, tactile organ, psyche, inclination, cleanliness, conduct,  behaviour, memory, facial expression, normalcy, morbidity, strength, malaise, in- tellect, exhilaration, roughness, unctuousness, drowsiness, initiation, severity, mild- ness, qualities (possessed by substance), diet, activities, digestion of food, manage- ment, mismanagement, disease, prodroma of diseases, complaints, complications,  lustre, shadow, dreams, messenger, bad omens in the way, changed condition of  the patient's residence, success of the therapy and application of remedy in disor- Out of these entities to be examined, some do not relate to the person while oth- ers do.

4629,5,
4630," Morbidity is of three types-that caused by bodily marks, that caused by diseases  and that caused by other factors. ",
4631,6,
4632," fhe first type of morbidity is that which is caused by the bodily marks due to  past deeds. Certain bodily marks are fixed in some body parts which produce abnor- mality by getting opportunity in favourable times. (1) The second type of morbidity is produced by obvious diseases which are de- scribed in the chapter on diagnosis in respect of their etiology. (2) The third type of morbidity is caused by factors which are not etiological in na- ture but resemble them in effect. In fact, it appears without any apparent cause and  indicates the measure of the life-span particularly the signs of imminent death due to  decadence of life. The physicians pay due importance to this and describe this for the  knowledge of life (and death). Based on this (I) will explain the signs observed in the  person which indicate his imminent death. This is the gist, (I) will explain it in detail  further. ",
4633,7,
4634," First of all (I will take) the topic erf complexion. Black, sky-like, skylike-fair and  fair-these are the normal shades of complexion of the body. There may be other shades  which should be known from the simile or the experts. ",

4640,9,
4641," Normal complexion in one half and abnormal one in the other half of the body  demarcated clearly as left and right, front and back, upper and lower or internal and  external should be known as arista (fatal sign) of the patient. Such demarcation of  complexions in face and other parts too indicate death (of the person). ",
4642,10,
4643," Similarly, on this line, malaise and cheerfulness, roughness and unctuousness  are described. ",
4644,11,
4645," In the same way, appearance of any one of mole, freckles, black mole, and pim- ple on the face of the patient should be taken as inauspicious. ",
4646,12,
4647," Appearance of any of the abnormal complexions in nails, eyes, face, urine, fae- ces, hands, feet, lips etc. particularly in patients with diminished strength, complex- ion and sense indicates the loss of life. ",

Other such voices may be known from simile or the experts. The abnormal voice is  like that of sheep (or goat) and is feeble, subdued, indistinct, choaked, faint, poor and  stammering and such other types of voice too which are abnormally different from the  earlier ones and appear for the first time. Thus normal and abnormal voices are de- scribed. ",
4655,15,
4656," Sudden appearance of the abnormal types of voice, presence of various voices or  of various types of one voice is regarded as inauspicious. Thus the topic of voice  ends. ",
4657,16,
4658, Thus the topics of complexion and voice are said properly for the knowledge of  the signs indicating death. ,
4659,17,
4660," Here are the verses- The abnormal complexion, if arises in the entire or half of the body without an  apparant cause, indicates death. In one half of the face is blue, blackish, coppery or reddish and the other one has  different complexion, it is a fatal sign. Unctuousness in one half of the face and roughness in the other one, malaise in  one half and cheerfulness in the other'is the sign of the dead. Black moles, moles, feckles and various streaks appear suddenly on the face of a  patient who is about to expire. ",

4663," Flower-like signs in the nails or teeth, muddy coating on teeth and powder-like  subtance on teeth are the sings of deeth. Abnormal colour in lips, feet, hands, eyes, urine, faeces and nails in weak patient  is fatal. The patient whose lips are blue (cyanotic) like ripe jamuna fruits should be re- garded as one devoid of life-span and about to die. If one or serveral abnormal voices suddenly appear in a decaying patients, it  indicates death. Whatever other abnormalities of voice and complexion are found in a patient  devoid of strength and flesh, they indicate the advent of death. ",

4675,5-Apr,
4676," Taking other resembling signs wrongly as the fatal ones, not knowing as such the  signs which are not fatal and not ascertaining the real fatal signs-all this is due to  intellectual error. ",
4677,6,
4678," In order to furnish knowledge in this respect, (I) will describe various flowered  cases having various types of signs preceding death. ",

4680," The person who emits constant fragrance resembling that of various flowers like  a blossomed forest with many trees and creepers is said as â€™ floweredâ€™, with fatal signs  and by the end of the year certainly gives up the body (dies). In this way, if one emits fragrance similar to that of individual flowers, desirable  or undesirable, he is known as flowered. If, in the patient's body, a physician perceives undesirable smell-collectively or  individually, the patient should be taken as flowered. Whether bathed or not, if the body becomes resort of desirable or undesir- able smells alternatively and without apparent cause the patient is said as flow- ered. Fc nstance-sandal, kustha,,tagara, aguru, honey and garland (with desir- able srneii; and urine, faeces, corpses or carcasses (with undesirable smell).

4684,16-Aug,
4685," Hereafter the informations about the taste arisen in the body of patient will be  described properly. The taste of the body in normal persons gets two types of changes  in the last moments. Some of the tastes become un-pleasant while others become ex- ceedingly pleasant. This sort of abormality may be known by inference because how  a man would receive the taste of another man. Flies, lice, stinging insects and mosqui- tos get away from the body with unplesant taste of a person who is about to die. (On  the other hand), flies are attracted constantly to the exceedingly sweet body of a pa- tient who is ripened enough for the time (death) even after bath and application of  cosmetics. ",
4686,17-22,
4687, Now the summing up verse- In general the signs of the flowered person in respect of taste and smell have  been described by me. One should predict death on their basis. ,

4695,3,
4696," One desiring to know the remaining span of life of a patient mainly by touch  should palpate his entire body with his normal hand or should get it palpated by some- body else. While palpating the body he should know the following entities such as-  loss of pulsation in body parts having constant pulsation, presence of coldness in  those which are always hot. Similarly hardness of the soft ones, coarseness of the  smooth ones, absence of the existent ones, looseness, dislocation or falling down of  joints, loss of flesh and blood, hardness, excessive perspiration, or stiffness and any  other such palpable sign having excessive morbidity and with no apparent cause. Thus  the features of palpable entities are said in brief. ",

4698," This is being explained in detail-if on palpation feet, knees, thighs, buttocks,  abdomen, sides, back, vertebral column, hands, neck, palate, lips and forehead  individually are felt as sweating, cold, stiff, hard or devoid of flesh and blood, it  should be known that the patient will die in a short time.

4712,  As propounded by Lord Atreya. ,
4713,2,
4714," Please listen how an expert physician should examine the sense organs in order  to know the span of life. As the sense organs transcend all the senses, they may be  examined, in reality, by inference. ",
4715,4-Mar,
4716, The perception pertaining to the sense organs which is abnormal and arisen with- out an apparent cause is indicative of death. This is in general about the inauspicious  signs relating to the sense organs and is described again in detail hereafter. ,

4732,12,
4733," If one sees the sun or the moon like an earthen mini pot covered with a black  cloth though they are quite clean, he does not live. Whether diseased or not if one visualises solar or lunar eclipse in their absence,  it indicates his death. If one sees the sun in night, or the moon in day or smoke arisen in absence of fire  or lustreless fire in night, he is about to die. When one is going to give up his existence, he sees brilliant objects as devoid  of brilliance, or non-brilliant objects as brillant ones or other objects devoid of  their normal characters. The persons, at the end of life, see the objects as deformed,  of different colour, in different number without an apperent cause. If one sees  the non-visible objects or does not see the visible one-both types of persons die  soon.",

4757, As propounded by Lord Atreya. ,
4758,2,
4759," (T ) will describe the prodroma of the incurable diseases separately in general as  well as specific way for the advancement of knowledge of the physicians. If a patient  of fever shows all the prodromal signs and symptoms mentioned in the context of  fever, he becomes a victim of death. In other diseases too, if prodroma are found in  such a way, it is a sure of death. ",
4760,5-Mar,
4761," Now (I) shall mention some of the severe prodroma which associate with the  diseases and are followed by death. If a person due to excessive sexual indulgence, is  affected with strength gradually decreasing and coryza gradually increasing, it leads  to phthisis and eventual death. If a patient is carried to the south by dogs, camels or  asses in dream, he is affected by phthisis leading to death. In dream, if one drinks  urine with ghosts or is dragged by dogs, he gets attacked by fever which becomes  fatal. ",
4762,9-Jun,
4763," If one sees the sky from nearby distance as (red) like a cloth dyed with lac,  he gets affected by internal haemorrhage which cuases his death. If one, in dream,  wearing red garland, red apparel, with his entire body red and while laughing fre- quently is dragged by a woman, he falls a victim to internal haemorrhage and dies  therefrom.

4764,page_no:504 ,
4765,0,
4766," Excessive colic, meteorism, gurgling sound, debility and discolouration of  nails etc. indicate the advent of gulma causing death eventually. In dream, if one  gets in his cardiac region a spiny creeper growing, he is affected by gulma which is  fatal. ",
4767,13-Dec,
4768," If, even on with slightest touch there is execessive tearing and wounds do not  heal, such person would be affected by fatal leprosy. In dream, if lotus flowers arise  in the chest of a person who is naked, bathed with ghee and pouring oblations to  flame-less fire he dies of leprosy. ",
4769,14-15,
4770," It flies are attracted too much to the body of person even after bath and after- paste it indicates the advent of prameha which leads to his death. One who, in dream,  drinks various fats in company of candalas and is bound by them, gets attacked with  fatal type of prameha. ",
4771,16-17,
4772,"  Fixed look, exhaustion, agitation, inopportune confusion, restlessness and de-  bility-these indicate the advent of insanity and consequent death. The expert physician observing a person having dislike for food, loss of mind  and urticarial rashes should declare him as a would-be case of fatal type of insanity. One who is irritable, terrorised, rarely having smile on his face, and with exces- sive fainting and thirst, gets fatal insanity. One who, in dream, sinks in water while  dancing with demons gets insanity which leads him to the other world. While awake, if one sees darkness which is not existing and hears various non- existing sounds, he dies of epilepsy. In dream, one who is carried away in reverse position by a ghost while intoxi- cated and dancing, is carried away by death preceded by epilepsy. ",

4778,24-25,
4779, One who knows these prodroma well can understand their association (with dis- eases) and result (death). ,

The dream of a woman-black-complexioned, sinner, characterless, with long  hairs, nails and breast, devoid of cosmetics, garaland and apparel-is just like the night  of death. These are the severe dreams which indicate the death of a patient while one de- void of illness, in rare cases, escapes even after reaching the doubtful point. ",
4785,27-40,
4786, A person sees severe dreams in critical period due to filling up of mind-carrying  channels by exceedingly powerful three dosas. A person comes across various fruitful  or fruitless dreams in subconscious stage because of the mind leading the sense or- gans. ,
4787,41-42,
4788,"  Dream is known as of seven types such as-based on (1) visual experience, (2)  auditory experience, (3) other experience, (4) strong desire, (5) imagination, (6) fu- ture consequences and (7) dosas. ",
4789,43,
4790," Out of them, the first five are fruitless and also those experienced in day, and  which are too short or too long. The dream experienced in early hours of night yields  small result, if one does not sleep again after experiencing the dream, it is highly and  immediately fruitful. If after experiencing aiTinauspicious dream one sees again a  soothing and auspicious dreams just afterwards-it yields good result. ",

If one suffers from oedema which starting from abdomen spreads to the ex- tremities, he is killed by the disease after putting the family members in great calamity. One who has oedema in feet, calf muscles laxed and both the legs weakened  should be discarded by physician. A physician should not prescribe medicine for a patient who suffers from oedema  in hand, feet, private parts and abdomen alongwith reduced complexion, strength and  food. ",
4815,14-Nov,
4816," The patient who expectorates profuse sputum having blue or yellow colour or  with blood should be discarded even from distance. The learned physician should discard from distance a patient having horripilation,  viscous urine, oedema, cough, fever and emaciation. If a patient who is emaciated and weak gets afflicted with distressing aggrava- tion of all the three dosas, should not be treated. Fever and diarrhoea at the end of oedema and oedema at the end of the former  two particularly in a weak patient indicates death. The patient who is aneamic, extremely emaciated, and has excessive thirst, ab- dominal distension and difficult respiration should be discarded by the learned physi- cian.

4821," If severe diseases having conflicting sources of origin and treatment aggravate  with galloping speed, the patient will die soon. If there is instantaneous reduction of strength, understanding, digestion, flesh  and blood, it indicates immediate death. If one loses his health and normal constitution he is to die suddenly. ",
4822,21-24,
4823, Now the summing up verse- These are the physical abnormalities which should be discarded. The wise do not  find any success with treatment in these conditions. ,

4838," 'Samsthana' means shape which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical. Measure- ment of persons is of three types-medium, short and tall. ",
4839,8,
4840," The image reflected in water, mirror, sunlight etc. according to measurement and  shape (of the individual) is known as praticchaya (shadow) while chaya, in restricted  sense, means the shade based on lustre and complexion. ",

That predominant in ap  is clear life pure vaidurya (cat's eye) and much unctuous. The chaya predominant in  prthivl is stable, unctuous, solid, smooth, sky-colour or white. Of them, the chaya  based on vayu is despised while the other four are auspicious; the former causes death  or great calamity. ",

The patient while being lifted up gets fainted now and then does not survive for  a week. The patient afflicted with ascending and descending disorders simultaneously  and with disordered grahanl, does not survive for a fortnight. ",
4852,18-20,
4853," If a person afflicted with a disease is emaciated and takes little food but excretes  urine and stool in large quantity, he should be discarded. (On the contrary), if a weak patient eats too much but passes scanty urine and  stool should be regarded as a ghost. If a person takes favourite and nutritious food but is constantly reduced in  strength and complexion, he does not survive. If a patient groans, respires profusely and passes diarrohoeic stools and is, at  the same time, weak, afflicted with thirst and dryness of mouth, he does not survive. One who has shallow respiration and irregular twitchings in the body is said as  nearly dead by Atreya Punarvasu. The patient who has respiratory failure and abundance of mucus alongwith dimi- nution of complexion, strength and diet, does not survive. ",

If the penis is excessively shrunken and testicles too much pendulous or vice  versa, it indicates patient's death. The patient whose muscles are wasted and is thus reduced to skin and skeleton,  who is too weak and does not take food, lives utmost for a month. ",

4875," A patient who is reducing but his nasal ridge becomes large and though not swol- len looks as swollen should be discarded by the wise. If the nostils are too much dilated or too much constricted and the nose is crooked  or dry-it indicates death.

The tongue as stiff, insensitive, heavy, much thorny, blackish, dry or swollen  should be considered as the moving tongue of a ghost. If a patient takes deep inspiration and shallow expiration with fainting he should  be considered as having obstructed life-span and should be discarded by the wise. Hands, feet, carotid regions and palate-these parts become excessively cold and  hard or soft at the end of life. The patient who rubs his one knee with the other one, fells down the legs after  raising them and turns away his face frequently, does not survive. The patient who cuts his nail tips with teeth, hairs with nails tips and scrapes the  ground with wooden piece does not recover from illness. One who gnashes teeth while awake, weeps and laughs loudly and does not feel  pain, is not freed from illness.

The patient who is about to die has his neck unable to keep the head on, back  unable to take up the weight of his body and jaws unable to bear the morsel of the  mouth. Sudden rise of temperature in fever, thirst, fainting, debility and dislocation of  joints-these signs indicate death. If the patient suffering from pralepaka (hectic) type of fever has profuse sweat- ing on face in early morning, the chances of his survival are rare. If the food does not reach the pharynx, instead the tongue reaches there and  there is extreme deterioration of strength, it indicates the end of life. ",

4896," The patient whose eyes are blackish, greenish and destroyed should be known  as having reached the end of his life. The patient who is unconscious having dryness of mouth and full of diseases  should be considered as having obstructed life span and be discarded by the wise. If the person suffering from paittika disorders has green views, blocked hair fol- licles, and desire for sour things he succumbs to death. Pain in scapular regions, hiccup, haemoptysis, hardness of bowels, chest pain  lead the patient of phthisis to death. In the state of loss of strength and flesh, the diseases like vatavyadhi, epilepsy,  leprosy, oedema, abdominal diseases, gulma, diabetes, phthisis and others become  incurable and as such should be discarded by the physician. If a patient having been relieved of hardness of bowels by purgation develops  thirst and tympanitis, he should be considered as ghost. One who, because of excessive dryless of throat, mouth and chest, is unable to  drink anything does not survive. If a patient develops weakness of voice, diminution of strength and complexion,  and aggravation of disease without an apparent cause, it indicates death. A wise physician should discard the patient who has developed respiratory fail- ure, subnormal temperature, pain in groins and does not get any relief. ",
4897,13-Mar,
4898," The patient talking in feeble voice about his own approaching death and having  auditory hallucinations should be discarded from a distance. If the remission of diseases come suddenly with crisis particularly in a weak  patient, his survival is taken as doubtful by Atreya. If the relations of the patient request the physician begging for his life, the phy- sician should prescribe only the diet with meat soup and should not administer any  evacuative therapy. If, after a month, there be no improvement even on intake of vari- ous meat soup, his survival is rare. ",

When pitta following body heat reaches the temporals and causes disorder, the  disease is named as samkhaka which kills the patient within three days. The patient having frequent frothy haemoptysis and piercing pain in abdomen  should be discarded. Severe loss of strength and flesh, aggravation of disease and anorexia indicate  the death of the patient within three fortnights. ",

Severe type of vatasthlla  (stone-like enlargement with predominance of vata) quite aggravated and located in  the cardiac region associated with excessive thirst causes sudden death. If vayu, while moving in body, slackens the calf regions and makes the nose  crooked, it causes sudden death. The disease causing hiccup and associated with drooped eyebrows and severe  internal burning brings sudden death. In a patient having loss of blood and flesh, if vayu moves upwards and affects  both the carotid regions equally, it takes away the life suddenly. If vayu moves suddenly from anus to navel and produces pain in a weak patient,  it takes away the life suddenly. If vayu stretching the tips of ribs seizes the chest while the patient is having cold  clammy perspiration and eyes dilated, it takes away the life suddenly. If strong vayu seizes both anus and heart particularly in a weak patient, it takes  away the life suddenly. If strong vayu while seizing groins and anus produces dyspnoea in a patient, it  takes away the life suddenly. ",

4917," If vayu causes cutting pain in navel, urine, head of the urinary bladder, and stool,  it takes away the life suddenly. If there is tearing pain in groins due to vata alongwith diarrhoea and thirst, it  indicates sudden death. The patient whose entire body is pervaded by vayu and who has diarrhoea and  thirst, dies suddenly. The patient whose body is swollen due to vata alongwith diarrhoea and thirst,  dies suddenly. One who has got cutting pain in stomach alongwith diarrhoea and thirst dies  suddenly. One who has got cutting pain in intestines alongwith thirst and intense pain in  anus dies suddenly. If vayu located in intestines, produces unconsciousness and stertorous breathing,  it takes away the life suddenly. Teeth as annointed with mud, face as if powdered, body parts having cold clammy  perspiration indicate patient's sudden death. A patient afflicted with thirst, dyspnoea, headache, fainting, debility, groaning  and diarrhoea dies soon. ",

4919," Now the summing up verse- One who knows these signs well, knows the life as well as the death of the  mortals. ",

4928," A patient whose offering is not accepted by crows goes to the other world within  a yeat to eat the offered bolus. One who does not see ArundhatT (a star) situated near the seven sages (the great  bear in the sky) faces the great darkness (death) by the end of the year. The patient who gains or loses lustre, corpulence or wealth survives utmost for a Inclination, conduct, memory, sacrifice, intellect and strength-these six entities  go away from the patient who is to die within six month. ",
4929,17,
4930," The patient in whose forehead is seen a beautiful network of unforeseen blood  vessels does not survive beyond six months. If the forehead of a patient is full of cresent-shaped streaks, it indicates his death  within six months. ",
4931,9-Aug,
4932," If there are found tremors in the body, stupor, movements and speech like an  insane, it indicates death within a month. The patient whose semen, urine and stool sink in water and who dislikes his kins  drowns in the waters of death within a month. ",

4937," If the extremities and the face are dried up or swollen without the main trunk of  the body, it indicates death of the patient within a month. Appearance of a crescent-shaped blue streak in forehead, head or pelvic region  indicates death of the patient. The patient in whose body masurika (chicken pox) errupts like coral beads and  disappear instantaneously, dies soon. I he patient having severe pressing pain in neck, glossitis and inflammation in  inguinal glands, mouth and throat should be regarded as ripened (for death). Excessive giddiness, delirium and breaking pain in bones-these three symptoms  appear in a patient having noose of death (in his neck). If a patient after fainting pulls out his hairs and is weak inspite of taking too  much food like a healthy person should be taken as one impelled by death. ",
4938,17-Dec,
4939,"  The patient who searches for his fingers and hands putting them before his eyes  and smiles while having his eyes directed upwards and unblinking should be taken  as blinded by death. The patient who being confused searches for something non- existing in bed, seat, body parts wooden furniture or wall should be taken as impelled  by (death) time. ",
4940,18-19,
4941," If a patient, due to mental confusion, laughs irrelevantly, licks his lips and has  feet, hands and breathing as cold does not survive. A patient having his mind covered with great tamas (the principle of ignorance)  does not peceive even though looking at their kins or attendants who are calling him  from nearby. ",

4943, The wise physician finding absence and excess of akasa etc. (mahabhutas) si- multaneously in the patient's body should not prescribe medicines. ,
4944,22,
4945," When diseases aggravate severely and mental strength deteriorates, the owner  of the body (self) leaves his abode known as 'deha' (body). At the approaching death, complexion, voice, power of digestion, strength of  speech, sense organs and mind-all these diminish, and sleep comes ever or never.  ",

4954, The physician should examine the life-span of the healthy as well as the dis- eased. The entire fruit of this knowledge continues in the physician having attained  the same. ,
4955,28,
4956, Now the summing up verse- The signs (or marks) produced by the dosas having trensecended the remedial  measures and which pervade the entire body are known as 'arista' (fatal signs). Thus ends the eleventh chapter on poor digestion etc. in Indriyasthana  in the treatise composed by Agnivesa and  redacted by Caraka.

4963," The patient on whose head a powdery substance like that of cow-dung powder  appears and on application of oil disappears, survives only by the end of the month. One who, due to morbidity, runs here and there with drooped shoulders and legs  rubbing together does not live longer. The person whose chest goes dried up soon while all other parts are wet after  bath and after paste, does not survive for a fortnight. The patient for whom the physician, inspite his efforts, does not succeed in ar- ranging the remedial measures, rarely survives. If a remedy well-known, well-tried and administered properly does not succed,  the case may be considered as incurable. The patient who does not achieve the fruit of the diet taken even if it is well  prepared under the guidance of the physician rarely survives. ",
4964,8-Mar,
4965,"  Under the topic of the messenger, (I) shall mention the fatal signs observing  which the physician should reject the case undoubtedly. ",
4966,page_no:524 ,
4967,0,
4968," The physician seeing the arrived messenger as dishevelled or naked or weeping  or unattentive should predict the death of the patient. If the messengers come while the physician is asleep or cutting or breaking  (something), the physician should not accompany them to their master (the patient). If the messengers arrive when the physician is offering oblations to the fire or  bolus to the forefathers, it indicates death of the patient. If messengers arrive when the physician is speaking or thinking about inauspi- cious things, the patient dies. If the messengers arrive when the physician is thinking or speaking about the  dead, burnt or lost or other inauspicious things, it indicates patient's death. If the messenger comes in a place or a time similar to the disease in properties,  the phycisian should not treat the patied. The messengers as anxious, frightened, hurried, terrorised and unclean; unchaste  women, three in number, having deformities, or enunch indicate death of the patient. If a physician observes a messenger having trouble in some organ, ascetic, dis- eased or engaged in harsh activities, he should not go with him. If a messenger of the patient comes on a cart carried by ass or camel, it indicates  the patient's succumbing to death. Before meeting (while waiting for) the physician, if the messenger touches straw,  chaff, flesh, bone, hairs, body hairs, nail, teeth, broom, pounding rod, winnowing  basket, shoes, fallen leather, grass, wood, husk, charcoal, earthen cold or stone, it  indicates death of the patient. If the physician comes across bad omen while the messenger is conveying the  message about the patient, the physician should not go with him. If the physician, before, during or after receiving the message from the messen- ger, sees somebody diseased, dead or adorned like a dead, or something broken, burnt  or destroyed; hears similar words, perceives intensely pungent taste or stinky smell  like that of corpse or exceedingly harsh touch or other inauspicious entities it indi- cates death of the patient. Thus the topic about the messengers of the dying patients is  described. ",

4973," Now (I) shall mention the protentous signs observed in the way or patient's house. Sneezing, crying, slipping, falling, angry expression, beating, refutation, de- spising; fall or defection of cloth, turban, upper garment, umbrella and shoes; coming  across the people afflicted due to death of somebody, falling down of sacred tree,  flagstaff, flag or pitcher full of water; talking about death or inauspicous things,  pollution with ashes or dust, crossing of road by cat, dog or serpent; cries of cruel  animals and birds facing south, seeing cot, chair and vehicles stretched out-these  have been said as inauspicious by the learned. The wise physician seeing or hearing  these in the way should not proceed to the patient's a house. Thus are said the  protentious signs observed in the way which are despised by the physicians. Physician should also observe the protentous condition of the patient's house.  Such as-going out of full pitcher, fire, earth, seed, fruit, ghee, bull, brahmana, gems,  food and idol of gods while the physician enters; the physician while entering into the  dying patient's house sees the five vessels as broken or flameless. The family mem- bers of the moribund person use the things which are cut, split, burnt, broken, kneaded  or weak. The patient whose bed, clothes, vehicle, movement, eating and bird's perch- ing are heard as inauspicious is not curable. The patient whose friends use beds,  clothes, vehicles, or other accessories like dead bodied should himself be treated as  dead. While cooking food for the patient, if the food gets exceedingly damaged or  the fire gets extinguished even though there is no wind and the fuel is sufficient, it  indicates incurability of the patient. , If earthen pots in the patient's house fall down or get broken frequently, the  chances of his survival are rare.

4978," Whatever is described with details in twelve chapters in respect of the signs  indicating death of the moribund persons will now be said in brief in other words. To  repeat something in a different way provides better understanding of the ideas. It is  not intended to repeat the same thing, too much in the same chapter, which has already  been said earlier. ",
4979,40-42,
4980," Now (I) will describe the symptoms and change in condition, as proposed  and accepted in traditions, indicating departure of the self who having lived in  the body for the maximum period prepares to migrate out of the body after relinqu- ishing the beloved vital breath, giving up the beautiful abode and entering into  the final darkness when all the systems and organs are disintegrated such as-the  vital breath is afflicted, understanding is obstructed, organs discharge, strength,  activities recede, senses are lost, consciousness is isolated, restlessness and fear enter  into the mind, memory and intellect leave away, modesty and grace get away, disorders ",

These are the signs of the moribund persons which have been said as proposed  and accepted in tradition. ",
4984,43-61,
4985," The physician, though observing the signs of death, should not disclose the  approaching death without having been requested for. Even on request, he should  not express it if is liable to cause patient's death or affliction to somebody else. The  experienced physician, without expressing patientâ€™s death should not be inclined to  treat him after observing the fatal signs. ",
4986,62-64,
4987," In case the physician observes the signs as contrary to those of death, he should  certainly tell about the approaching condition of health as indicated by favourable  messengers, propentous signs in the way or the patient's house, the conduct and  behaviour of the patient and availability of the desired medicaments. ",

4992," The physician should consider the approaching messenger as auspicious if he is  of good conduct, exhilarated, having no deformity or deficiency in the body, praise- worthy, with white dress, head unshaved and without matting, similar in birth, dress  and activity; coming on a cart not driven by camel or ass, not in early morning,  evening inauspicious and cruel stars or constellations, rikta tithis (vacant dates as  fourth, ninth and fourteeth date of the fortnight) noon, midnight, earth quake, solar  or lunar eclipse, from inauspicious place, coming across protentious signs in the way  and in unperturbed state.

4993,67-70,
4994," Auspicious signs in the way are as follows-seeing curd, barley, brahmanas, bulls,  king, precious stones, full pitcher, white horse, flag staff or flag of temples, fruits,  half-boiled cereals, earthen saucers made in the form of girls and boys, one animal  tied, ploughed land, kindled fire, white sweet balls and flowers, sandal, delicious food  and drinks, cart full of human beings, milch cow, mare and women with her child;  cukor, siddhartha, sarasa (crane), priyavadi, swan, satapatra, blue jay, peacock, fish,  goat, elephant tusk, Conch, fruits of priyahgu, ghee, ornaments of horses, mirror, yel- low mustard, gorochana; fragrant smell, white colour, sweet taste, auspicious voice  of animals, birds and human beings, unfolding of umbrella, flags and banners, devo- tional songs, sound of kettle drums and conches, auspicious recitals, sounds of vedic  recitation, soothing and favourable wind.

4999," Auspicious signs in the patient's house are as below-the family members in- cluding the patient endowed with auspicious conduct, respectful, favourable,  abundance of materials, attainment of wealth, superiority and happiness, acquisition  of the desired object with ease, administration of useful drugs and success thereby;  dreams of climbing on house, palace, hill, riding on elephants, bull, horse and men;  seeing the moon, the sun, fire, brahmanas; cows and women having lactation, swiming  of oceans, advancement, getting out of difficulty, talk with pleased gods and  forefathers, seeing white clothes, clean tank, receiving meat, fish, poison, unclean  objects, umbrella and mirror, white flowers, journey on cart driven by horse and  bull, journey to the east and the north, weaping, rising after fall and subduing enemies.  ",
5000,80-86,
5001," Presence of the symptoms of good psyche, devotion to physician and brahmanas,  curability of the disease, absence of frustration-these are the signs of the recovery  from illness. When the patient is free from illness the man having auspicious signs,  attains strength, long life-span and great happiness and other desired objects. ",
5002,87-88,
5003," Now the summing up verses- In the chapter on cowdung-like powder the signs of death and recovery have  been described in respect of messengers, dreams, patient's conduct, protentous signs,  administration of drugs and success. Thus this context has been explained properly which should be constantly exam- ined by the physician. By this he attaint success, standing reputation and wealth be- cause of his success in the profession. ",

A burning sensation in the affected eye as well as its consequential inflammation would result from the use of too hot (warm) or strong or keen-potencied (Tikshna) extract for the purpose. A thrilling sensation (Harsha), pain and numbness in the locality and lachrymation from the affected organ originate from the use of a cold and mild-potencied Puta-paka or Tarpana eye-drop. Red- ness and contraction of the eye attended with a jerking and throbbing sensation therein are the effects of an excessive (over-dose) application of the Tarpana, whereas a deficient (under-dose) use of them produces an aggravation of the deranged bodily Doshas in the locality.

The application of an Anjana would be abortive, nay, it would rather aggravate the Dosha, if applied before sun-rise, after a bath, or in a very cold day, owing to the fixedness of the deranged bodily Dosha. Similarly, the application of an Anjana would fail to produce any effect in a case of indigestion, owing to the sluggish condition of the internal passages of the body (during the continuance of the disease).

The medical treatment in such instances consists in the employment of soothing (Santarpana) and other Vayu-subduing remedies.

They were created by the gods Agni, and the goddesses Krittika and Uma for guarding the person of the new-born Guha though protecting himself with his own divine prowess amidst the stems of S'ftra grass. Of these Grahas the females who are possessed of \-arious shapes as described before are considered as originally made of the Rdjasa essence of the goddesses Ganga, UmA and Krittika. 2A. The Xaigamesha Graha who is possessed of a sheep's face was created by the goddess Parvati as the friend and protector of the young god Guha and who was as dear to him as his own self. Skanddpasmara, the presiding deity of the disease named after him, was created by Agni, the fire-god (Vulcan). He is as bright as fire itself and is a constant companion of the god Skanda and is also known by the name of Vis'akha, The god .Skanda, the tutelar divinity of the disease of that denomination, was begotten by His Holiness, the Almighty Destroyer of Tripura and is otherwise known by the name of Kumara (lit. a child, t'/c, of Maha- deva). 2JI It is impossible that the god springing from Rudra and Agni, with his exalted parentage would find pleasure in such a dangerous disease even out of childish frolic- 21 ",

The god Skanda in his turn, referred them to His Holiness the god Siva for the answer, whereupon they went to the latter in a body and made the same query. Mahddeva, the Destroyer of Bhaga's eyes, replied ""Gods, men and other animals, O, ye Grahas, exist The gods minis- ter to the wants of men and beasts, etc., by marshalling different seasons of the year and by setting the air in motion and sending down the rain, and men, in their turn, propitiate the gods by duly and reverentially per- forming the sacrificial rites, by saying their prayers with blended palms, by bowing down in reverence, and by repetition of prayers, religious vows and other religious observances. All services and their emokmients in consequence have been filled up and settled and there remains nothing for you to fiii. Your proper means of subsistence will, therefore, be in the life of an infant (though the emoluments you shall receive shall be stained with the tears of man\' an anxious, \vatchful and night-worn parent). 3 A.

Attack them without least compunction of heart and ample means of subsistence will be thereby secured to you). There the parents of children will worship you in their calamities and you shall get plenty to live upon.'' 3B. Thus the Grahas came into being and began to attack the children (of iniquitious parents), and it is therefore that a child attacked by a malignant Graha becomes very hard to be cured. Death or permanent disfigurement of an\- limb or organ is sure to ensue from an attack of Skanda Graha, since he is the most dreadful of all the Grahas.

The specific features of the Pitta-origined type are that the stool is fetid, hot, yellow, blue or slightly red-coloured, or resembles the washings of meat, and is emitted with sharp or acute force and is accom- paincd by thirst, epileptic iits (fainting), burning sensa- tion, perspiration, suppuration and inflamation (Paka) of the affected organs, and fe\cr. In the Kapha- origined type of the disease the stool becomes loose and constant, gets mixed with the lump of mucus and looks white. The stool comes out w ithout any sound.

The symptoms which mark a case of Tri-doshaja type (due to the concerted action of the three simultaneously deranged bodily Doshas) are drowsiness, swoon, lassitude, dryness of the mouth, thirst and a varied colour of the stools. A case of Tri-doshaja type, if attended with all the symptoms, is very hard to cure and if occurring in an infant, or an old person, is scarcely amenable to medical treatment. Symptoms and Amaja Atisara suppressed tears of a bereaved person of sparing diet, on quenching the digestive fire, reach down into the Koshtha (intestines) and there freely mix with, and vitiate the local blood which becomes dark-red like Kdkananti (Gunja). It then passes through the rectum, charged with a peculiar fetour impart- ed to it by the fecal matter in case of its combi- nation with the latter or without any fetid smell, when passing out unmixed. Such an attack ushered in by the grief of bereavement of a person is according- ly considered very hard to cure. The local bodily Doshas in the Koshtha (abdomen) are aggravated and deranged when they come in contact with the Ama (unassimilated chyle), and are brought down into the Koshtha (bowels), where they are more agitated and emitted in combination with the undigested fecal matter in various ways, and are attended with pain and characterised by a variety of colour.

A patient suffering from an attack of Atisara would be given up (as incurable) if he be weak, if the orifice of his anus become suppurated and cannot be closed, if there be distension of the abdomen (D.

6108," Other causes of and their symptoms grief, old age, over- fatiguing physical exercise, toils of journey, fasting, ulcers and ulceration of the Urah (lungs) are included by certain authorities within the exciting factors of this disease, Sosha. A case of Sosha due to sexual excess is attended with all the symptoms due to loss of semen and is marked by palour or yellowness of the complexion, the vital organic principles beginning with semen being wasted up in succession in their inverse order of enumeration. Constant brooding over the departed person, looseness of the limbs and all the symptoms of sexual excess other than the actual dis- charge of semen mark a case due to grief. A general cachectic condition of the body accompanied by imbeci- lity of the mind, diminution of bodily strength, impaired functions of the sense-organs, laboured or difficult breath- ing (U. R. shivering of the limbs), aversion to food, a gong-like voice, expectorations marked by the absence of mucus (A. R. hea\ incss of the limbs), a general apathy to the concerns of life and (constant mucus) secretions from the ears, nose, eyes and mouth are the .symptoms which indicate the origin of the disease i in the natural and spontaneous waste of an extreme old age.

6111," A case due to the toils of journey or travel develops such symptoms as looseness of the limbs, flabbiness of the muscles, scorched or burntness of complexion, a haggard and cadaverous look, a gone-feeling in the limbs, the absence of natural gloss of the body and dryness of the mouth, throat and of the Kloma. These symptoms in addition to those of the ulcerated lungs (Urah-Kshata) without actual ulceration, characterise the type due to over-fatiguing physical exercise. 13-14 If a case of ulcer is attended by loss of blood, pain and difficult}' in eating, it is turned to a case of Sosha and is pre-eminently the most uncurable type of the desease. Rupture or ulceration in the lungs (Urah- kshata) is caused by physical exercises, lifting up heavy loads, excessive and loud reading, a hurt or a blow, or excessive sexual congress and such other acts as require the active co-operation and entail excessive straining of the chest (Urah). They ultimately dis- charge blood and pusy secretions. Yellowish, black or purple coloured blood is expectorated or hawked out by coughing. A burning sensation is felt inside the region of the chest. A fetid smell is felt in the mouth and in the breath. The complexion of the body and the tone of the voice is changed and the patient becomes senseless from the excessive pain he suffers from. In certain cases the symptoms vary according to the varied natures of their exciting factors, and all the specific symptoms arc not full\' exhibited. Never- theless these diseases also go under the denomination of Kshaya (consu'nption) owing to the fundamental vital principles of the body being equally consumed or withered up in them, and the specific niode of their treatment has alread}- been explained before (Chapter XV, Sutra-Sthana). 15-iy.

The Gulmas are so named because their root or base cannot be exactly localised as well as their cause cannot be exactly ascertained owing to the fact of their having their origin in the aggravated condition of the local bodily Vayu, or because of their being but a agglomeration of the deranged bodily Doshas in the affected locality and the shrub-like large converse outline of the surface (Gulma-shrub). Since a Gulma, like a bubble of water, is a self-contained agglomeration of the deranged bodily Doshas and freely moves about in the cavity of its growth, it is not marked by the advent of ",

The Gulmas are the products of either the several or con- certed actions of the three Doshas, while in females a separate class of tumours (such as the ovarian or uterine tumours) intimately connected with the deranged or vitiated condition of the blood (catamenial fluid, etc) is also recognised. 3â€” ",

Hence it may be presumed that as seeds sprout in autumn only, when the rains make the ground ready to receive them, the shortness of time being counted as no factor potent enough to obstruct the process (of sprouting), so the deranged Doshas of the body though gradually aggravated bring on, as a matter of fact, an attack of Apasmara with all its concomitant symptoms, only under conditions favour- able to its appearance which may, however, be short and transitory in its duration.

A medicine taken with each alternate morsel of food is called Gratsaintara Emetics and Dhumas as well as the well-known and well-experi- mented lambatives for cases of asthma should be administered in this form. These are the ten proper occasions for administering medicines. ",

6940," Proper time for [)roper tinie for giving diet to a patient is when he gets free stool, urine and eructations, and feels his body and sense-organs light and free, when he gets free actions of the heart as well as natural courses of his bodily hungry (D. R. feels easy) and has got relish for food and when his Kukshi (belly) becomes light (/"". e. when his belly appears to be empty on account of hunger). ",

6943," Now \vc shall discourse on the chapter which dea's with the technical terms used in this treatise (Tatltra- Yiikti-NÂ£(ma-Adhyaya). i. Names of the technical Tliere arc thirty-two technical terms in this Treatise. They are-(i) (2) Yoga, (3) Padartha, (1) Hctvartha, (5) Uddes'a, (6) Nirdes'a, (7) Upadesa, (8) Apadesa, (9) Fradcsa.. Atidesa.

",
6944,2,
6945," Necessity ;â€”What is the necessity of the use of these technical terms (Tantra-Yukti) The answer isâ€”Foi- connecting words together, /. c, making up sen- tences and giving a sense or meaning to them. ",
6946,3,
6947," terms in a scientific treatise the points of argument of the opposite party are frustrated and the points of one's own argument are established. The meanings of the words, whether clearly used or not, whether direct or indirect, or partially used, if there is any such, in the treatise are also made distinct (by the use of the techni- cal terms). Just as the sun shows a cluster of lotus and a lighted lamp (the inside of) a room at their best, so the technical terms used in a treatise clearly show i. i\, explain the intended meaning. ",
6948,4,
6949, ,
6950,407 Of terms Adhikarana is the subject about which something is spoken of. For exampleâ€”on (the subject of ) Rasa or on (the subject of) Dosha. ,
6951,5,
6952," The term 'Yoga"" is the union of words or sentences together. For exampleâ€”an oil duly cooked with Amrita-valli, Nimha, Himsrd, AbJiayd, Pippali, the two kinds of Bald and with Dcvd-ddru should be prescribed for drinking as being efificacious in all cases of Gala-ganda. Here the main idea is 'Siddham pivet' /. c. should be cooked and taken internally ; but the word 'Siddham' is used in the first half of the second hemistich, far away from the word 'Pivet' in the sentence. This combining together of the different words, however distant in a sentence, is called a Yoga. ",
6953,6,
6954," The term ""Padartha"" is the meaning implied by a word or an aphorism (z. c. a sentence). Padarthas arc innumerable. For exampleâ€” Sneha, Svcda, or Anjana, when used in a sentence, would each imply two or three meanings ; but only one meaning which tallies with the use of the previous or subsequent word (in the text) should be understood in each case. Thus, in the sen- tence ""Vedotpattim VyAkhya syamah"" /. e. we shall discourse on the origin of the the use of the word '""Veda"" would put the hearer at a loss to under- stand which of the Vedas is going to be discoursed on, for there are several Vedas, w,o', Rigveda, e.c. But when we try to understand the expression in connection with the previous or subsequent use of the expression - for the root 'vid' may mean either 'Vicharana"" (discussion) or 'Vindati"" (to get) â€”we can afterwards come to the conclusion that the subject to be discoursed upon is the origin of Ayurveda. This is what is meant by the term Padartha, ",
6955,7,
6956, Hetwartha is the meaning indirccth- implied by a ,
6957,"word. For exampleâ€”as earth is moistened by water, so an ulcer is moistened ;and consequently secretes) by (the taking of) Afds/ia-pu\se, milk, etc. ",
6958,8,
6959, Uddes'a is the statement in brief. For example Salya (ordinarily any foreign matter but secondarily implying any obstructing matter in the body). ,
6960,9,
6961," Nirdesa is the statement in detail. For example ""Salya"" is of two kinds ""Sdrira"" (idiopathic) and ""Agantu"" (traumatic). ",
6962,10,
6963, Upadesa is an instruction for the doing of a thing in a particular way. For exampleâ€”one should not sit up at night and one should give up sleep at the daytime. ,

6966,12,
6967," Pradesa is the determination of a present action from past events. For exampleâ€”Devadatta's Salya has been extracted by this person, hence Yajnadatta's Salya will also be extracted by him. 1 ",
6968,3,
6969," Atidesa is the determination of some future event from some present event. For exampleâ€”one's bodily Vdyu courses upwards by such and such an action, hence one may get (an attack of Vdtaja) Udavarta by such an action. ",
6970,14,
6971," Apavarga is the extractionâ€”/. e. exception of (some- thing) from something more comprehensive or extended, that is to say, it is an exception to the general rule. For exampleâ€”fomentation should not be applied to persons suffering from the effects of poisoning excepting those suffering from insect-poison. 15, is the word the absence of the use of which does not make the sentence incomplete. For example -when we say of the head, the hands, the legs, ",
6972," the sides, the back, the abdomen ( Udara ) and the chest"" it becomes evident that these (parts) of a are intended. ",
6973,16,
6974," Arthapatti (presumption"" is the term used when the sense (of a though not specifically men- tioned, can yet be indirectly presumed or deduced. For says to another 'this rice (solid food) can be taken,' it becomes evident that he is not willing to drink a (liquid) Yavagu or gruel. ",
6975,17,
6976," Viparyaya (reverse) is the term used when the words used (in a sentence) convey quite a different or opposite sense. For example, -when it is said that 'ema- ciated, weak and frightened persons are very difficult to be medically treated', the opposite sense becomes evident, viz., that strong, and such-like persons are very easy to be medically treated. ",
6977,18,
6978," Prasanga (connected reasoning) is the term used when a different subject is introduced at the end. It is also the term used when the same sense is repeated in different words in different places (in the same topic). For example â€” it is said in the chapter on Vedotpatti (Chapter I, Sutra-Sthana) that 'Turusha"" (livng organism) the five primary elementsâ€” o'/.s., earth, water, fire, air and clhcr) and the Sariri (or the soul), that medical treat- ment should be made of him (Purusha) and that he is the subject matter of every action) ; and it has been repeated in the chapter on Bhuta-vidya (demonology) that the Purusha has therefore been said to be the combination of the five Mahd-bhutas and the soul and ' The common example of .in Arlhapalli ([jrcbumplion) in Sanskrit philosophy is 'Pino Dcvadallo diva na bliuniklc,' (/. tf. , Fat Ucvadalta docs not eat at day-linic), from which it is evident that he certainly eats at night, otherwise he could not have become fat. 52 ",
6979, that he is the subject-matter of all sorts of medical treatment. ,
6980,19,
6981," is the term used to denote a thing which is certain in every case. For example Trivrit causes purgation, and Madana-ixmX. produces vomiting. ",
6982,20,
6983," is the term used to denote certainty in some cases and uncertainty in some other cases. For exampleâ€”many authorities hold that 'Dravya' or the thing itself is the principal factor, some hold the Rasa' or taste (in a thing) to be the principal factor, some again hold the ''Viryya"" or potency to be the principal factor and others hold ""Vipaka"" or digestive reaction to be the principal factor. ",
6984,21,
6985, Purva-paksha is (the putting of) a question with an apparent objection. For exampleâ€”(the question why are the four kinds of Vataja-Prameha incurable. ,
6986,22,
6987," or question. For affects i. e. spreads over the (whole) body and then forces the urine through (the passage with the (vitiated bodily Vasd (grease\ Majjan (marrow). The Vataja cases (of Prameha) are, therefore, incurable. As has been saidâ€” the (bodily) Vayu affects / c. spreads over the whole body and coming in contact with the (bodily; Medas (fat), Majjan (marrow) and Vasa (grease) becomes vitiated and courses downward. The Vataja cases (of Prameha) are, therefore, incuiable. ",
6988,23,
6989," Anumata is the term used when an opinion of another is (quoted but) not refuted. For exampleâ€”some authorities hold that there are seven Rasas or tastes. (Now, as this is not refuted it is said to be Auumata or sanctioned by the author). ",
6990,24,
6991," Vidhaina is the act of mentioning, at the beginning, the fact to be established. For exampleâ€” the vulnerable ",
6992," or vital parts (Marmans) in the thigh are eleven in number, and this has already been stated to be established. ",
6993,25,
6994, Ansigataivekshana is the term incd when something in the future is referred to in such terms as 'this will be dealt with hereafter'. For exampleâ€”it can be said in the Sutra-sthana 'it will be dealt with in the Chikitsita- sthdna'. ,
6995,26,
6996, Atikraintaivekshana is the term used when some- thing in the past is referred to. For exampleâ€” it can be said in the Chikitsita-sthana 'it has already been said in the Sutra-sthana'. ,
6997,27,
6998, Samsiya is the term used when examples of two opposite and dissimilar subjects are cited. For exampleâ€”hurt to the Tala-Hridaya (Marmans in the hands and legs) is fatal , amputation of the hand and of the leg is not fatal. 
6999,28,
7000, Vyaikhyana is the description or explanation of the details. For exampleâ€”Purusha as the twenty-fifth factor has been dealt with in this book. While only the twenty-four factors constituting this body have been dealt with in other works ,
7001,29,
7002, Sva-samjna( denotes the specific terms specially used in any work and not in common with any other work. For example -the term 'Mithuna' (in medical works) means ,
7003,30,
7004," is the example of what is well-estab- lished or well-known in the world. For exampleâ€” has been recognised here as a technical term. But it should not have been recognised as such, since it has not been included in the list (see para 2). Had it been so, the number would have been 3'{ and not ",
7005,32,
7006, Dallana prefers to regard thu portion after the sentence takes it in continuation of the example ,
7007,"cooling measures should be had recourse to to guard against warmth. 3T. Nirvachana is the derivation of a term. For ex- ampleâ€”Ayus (life) is the subject-matter of this work, and a man gets (the means of) Ayus (longevity) from this work and hence it is called Ayurveda. ",
7008,32,
7009," Nidars'ana is the term used when the meaning (of a word or sentence) is supported by examples. For exampleâ€”just as the (digestive) fire in the Koshtha (abdomen) increases in contact with (the local bodily) Vayu, so also an ulcer increases when assisted by the (bodily) Vayu, Pitta and Kapha. ",
7010,33,
7011, Niyoga is the enjoining of something to be done as a duty. For exampleâ€”only what is beneficial (Pathya) should be taken. ,
7012,34,
7013," Samuchchaya is the joining (ot two or more con- nected but independent ideas) as such and such. For exampleâ€”in the group of flesh, (those of) Ena and Harina (two kinds of deer), Lava and Tittira (two kinds of birds) and Saranga (spotted deer) are the principal ones. ",
7014,35,
7015," Vikalpa is the term used when something is said to be this or that, i. e., when alternatives are used. For- exampleâ€”either meat-soup or Yavagu (gruel) cooked with clarified butter (should be used in such and such a case). ",
7016,36,
7017," Uhya is the term used when something more can be understood by an intelligent man, though not defi- nitely used. For exampleâ€” it has been said in the chapter on Anna-pdna-vidhi (Chapter XLVI, Sutra- Sthana) that Anna (food) is of four kinds, via.,{\) in Ihe previous para. His meaning is that the word not found in the sense referred to in para. 30, the reader is asked to find out a ]iopular exflmple. ",
7018,"Bhakshj a (masticable) or the solid food that has to be bitten with the teeth before eating, (2) Bhojya (edible) or the solid food proper /. e., which has not to be bitten with the teeth, (3) Lehya (lambative) or the semi-liquid food that has to be licked like an electuary, and (4) Peya (drink) or the liquid food proper that has to be drunk ; but of these four kinds, two kinds only Anna and Paniya) have been mentioned (in naming the chapter). Here it is (said that the other two kinds) are) understood. For, when only two arc mentioned in respect of food and drink, the inclusion of all the four therein is easily comprehended. Because the term ' Bhakshya ' is included in the term ' Anna ' both being of the same kind, viz., solid food ; and the term 'Lehya' is included in the term 'Peya'â€” both being of the same kind, viz , liquid. And the articles of food, though they are really of four kinds, are usually spoken of in the common language as being of two kinds only {viz , solid and liquid). ",
7019,37,
7020," Here have been fully described by me the thirty- two technical terms for the investigation into the essence of this Tantra (work). The intelligent man who is fully conversant with these technical termsâ€”which work like lights, as it were,â€” is to be regarded as the greatest physician and to be held in great esteem.â€”This is what the Sage Dhanvantari says. ",
7021,38,
7022, Thus ends the sixty-fif'.h chapter of the Uttara-Tantra in the Sus'ruta- Samhita which deals with the technical terms used in this work ,
7023,"Now we shall discourse on the chapter which (deals with and) is called the different modifications (combi- nations) of the different Doshas â€”Dosha-Bhcda- vikalpa-namadhyaya. Revered Sus'ruta, the son of Vis'vAmitra, asks (the following to) the high-minded Divoddsa, well-versed in all the eight divisions of Ayurveda, with intellect sharp and as deep as an ocean, as it were, and with all the difficulties in the meanings of the Sdstras fully solved. The question is â€” It has been already said that there divided when taken one, two or all the three at a time' 2â€” ",
7024,3,
7025, On hearing his word the great sage and king (Divodasa) with all his difficulties solved was greatly pleased and thus narrated the true conditions to Sus'ruta. ,
7026,4,
7027," The three Doshas, the (seven) Dhatus, feces and unneâ€”these, in their normal state, hold together the corporeal frame in conjunction with the (six Rasas necessary (for the constitution). ",
7028,5,
7029," Puru-'ha or human body has sixteen sub-strataf. The Pranas (w,c. the organs of sense) are eleven in num- ber while the number of diseases is one thousand one hundred and twenty and that of elementary sub- reference is to chapter LXIII, but there the number is sixty-three and not sixty-two. The three Dhatus Vayu, Pitta and Kapha, in their normal state, cannot properly be called Doshas. The state in which all the three Dhatus are in their normal state, is said to be the 63 rd. combination (see also para. 8 below}. t The sixteen sub-strata are the five elementary principles, (viz.â€”Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether) and the eleven sense-organs. ",
7030,"Stances (Dravya) is five hundred and seventy-three, - these have already been explained In detail. The three qualities {vi.'J., Sattva, Rajas and Tamas) have also been explained in connection with the (three) different Doshas generally said to have sixty-tW) combinations. 6â€”",
7031,8,
7032," The three Doshas separately have three combina- tions, where one of the Doshas is aggravated and the other two are in their normal state. Taken two at a time, both of them aggravated, whether equally or unequally (with the third in its normal state), the number of combinations would be iiine ; while the number of combinations would be thirteen if they are taken three at a timeâ€”all of them aggravated, both equally and unequally (thus making twenty-five in all with the aggravated Doshas). With an equal number of combinations in cases of the diminution of the Doshas (taken one, two or three at a time) we have fifty combi- nations. The number of combinations (taken one, two and three at a time) with the aggravated and dimi- nished Doshas mixed together would be twel\ e only.â€” Thus making sixty-two in all. 9 The number of combinations, when mixed together, would be innumerable. It, therefore, behoves a physi- cian to treat a patient with the different combinations diff""crent) Rasas after properly diagnosing the disease with a due regard to the aggravation of the different Doshas and without going into any further details. In ameliorating a disease, the physician is the doer of that action the effect whereof is health and the instruments with which the action is performed are the Rasas while the Doshas are the causes. The site hereof is want of health. lu. ",
7033,"The Uttara-Tantra, enriched with the sixty-six chapters wherein have been described and explained the order of the words and their meanings, and wherein have been explained very clearly the hidden meanings of the terms for making them clear to persons of weak intellect, has thus been duly explained to you in accor- dance with your question, i r. Persons reading, according to the rules laid down, this treatise together with the Uttara-Tantra coming from (the mouth of) Brahma himself, are not abondoned by their wished for objects, that is to say, they are sure to obtain them. This word of Brahma is perfectly true. 1 2, Thus ends the sixty-sixth chapter of the Uttara-Tantra in the Sus'ruta- Samhita which (deals with and) is called the different combinations of the different Doshas. Here ends the Uttara-Tantra. THE END ",
